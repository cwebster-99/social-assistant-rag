Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a cloud computing expert, or a database guru, this hackathon is the perfect platform to showcase your skills and creativity.\\nMicrosoft Fabric is an integrated platform that combines data engineering, data warehousing, and data science in a seamless environment. It provides a unified experience for managing and analyzing data, enabling organizations to harness the power of their data more efficiently. With built-in AI capabilities, it allows users to automate processes, gain deeper insights, and accelerate decision-making, making it an essential tool for modern data-driven businesses.\\nTo ensure that you have all the tools necessary to build the next AI innovation with Microsoft Fabric and Azure Open AI, we are offering free access to Microsoft Fabric in addition to an Azure Open AI Proxy service that will allow you to use AI services without an Azure account.\\nWe are also providing a variety of live informational sessions and workshops to help expand your knowledge in an interactive setting. These events will be livestreamed by the Microsoft Reactor to YouTube.\\u00a0 You can view the full schedule and register to attend these sessions here. These will provide the opportunity to ask questions to the organizers & \\u00a0judges, but if you have questions outside of these event you can also join us for our upcoming AMA sessions (Sep 17) (Oct 8) on the Microsoft Tech Community. \\u00a0Additionally, you can join us in the Microsoft Fabric Community Forums and Devpost Discord for Q&A / support! \\nThis hackathon is more than just a competition\\u2014it's an opportunity to learn, innovate, and connect with like-minded individuals who are passionate about shaping the future of technology. We can't wait to see the incredible solutions you'll create!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          Requirements\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat to Build\\nComplete the Microsoft Learn AI Skills Challenge (Microsoft Fabric) and build a new Fabric solution that leverages Azure OpenAI services and falls into one of the following hackathon categories.\\n\\n\\nHackathon Categories:\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Fabric + AI Innovation\\n\\n\\nA solution that solves a real world problem with Microsoft Fabric by implementing any concept or collection of concepts related to Artificial Intelligence.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nThis could include a document analysis service that uses AI Skills or an Azure OpenAI based solution to implement a retrieval augmented generation architecture, training and deployment of a custom object detection model, anomaly detection, predictive forecasting, or any other modern application of AI within Microsoft Fabric. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReal-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric\\n\\n\\nA solution that uses Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) in Microsoft Fabric\\u00a0 to solve a real world problem.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nRTI is all about data integration, so showcasing how you can use RTI to integrate data from multiple sources and make real-time decisions based on that data is key. Any good RTI solution would include real-time data processing, real-time analytics, real-time monitoring, real-time alerting, or any other real-time application within Microsoft Fabric.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nUsing RTI as a source of data for your AI application is also a great way to showcase the power of RTI. Showcasing open-source integrations like Apache Kafka or AMQP, and showing cross-cloud or hybrid cloud integrations is also a plus, but not required.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAzure Database for PostgreSQL Integration\\n\\n\\nA real-world solution that uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL as an OLTP main transactional database and the transactional data has to be offloaded to Fabric for near real-time analytics. This could involve using Event streaming connector for Azure Database for PostgreSQL or other techniques such as Dataflows (Gen2), Notebooks, or Data Factory Pipelines. Data landing in Fabric can be used in near real-time intelligent scenarios such as anomaly detection, predictive maintenance and other predictive scenarios, or personalized recommendations amongst others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSQL And AI Integration\\n\\n\\nA real-world solution that is built on Microsoft Fabric that leverages Azure SQL Database or SQL Server, and augmented by AI capabilities. This could involve using Mirroring, Eventstream's Change Data Capture (CDC) Connector for Azure SQL DB, or using ingestion techniques such as Dataflows (Gen2), Notebooks, Data Factory Pipelines, and AI-driven analytics and insights.\\n\\nGet started with an Azure SQL database for free!\\n\\n\\n\\nAzure Cosmos DB + Microsoft Fabric Integration\\n\\n\\nA real-world solution that is built on Microsoft Fabric, leveraging Azure Cosmos DB. This could involve using Mirroring for enabling analytics/BI on Cosmos DB data, Eventstream's Change Data Capture (CDC) Connector for Cosmos DB, or using ingestion techniques such as Dataflows (Gen2), or Data Factory Pipelines.\\n\\nGet started with Cosmos DB for free!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nImportant Notes:\\n\\nAdditional consideration will be given if you are able to document how you were able to accomplish your solution using any of the available Copilots in Microsoft Fabric.\\nMicrosoft Learn AI Skills Challenge (Microsoft Fabric) opens on September 24, 2024 and must be completed by all team members by November 1, 2024.

The documents have already been retrieved based on initial search criteria, but your role is to refine the ranking by considering factors such as semantic similarity to the query, context relevance, and alignment with the user's intent. Focus on documents that provide concise, high-quality information, ensuring that the top-ranked documents answer the query as accurately and completely as possible. If you can't rank them based on semantic relevance, give higher rank to documents with VS Code features that were published most recently. Make sure to return the full name of the feature and URL of each release note document, and format your response as a Markdown list item, with the URL in parentheses. Do not include any additional information or commentary about the documents. List a variety of documents, and give more weight to documents that mention Python and or notebooks features.
