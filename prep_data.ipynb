       "{'content': 'Learn what is new in the Visual Studio Code September 2024 Release (1.94)\\n\\n**Update 1.94.1**: The update addresses this security [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22September+2024+Recovery+1%22+).\\n\\n**Update 1.94.2**: The update addresses these [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2024+Recovery+2%22+is%3Aclosed).\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nWelcome to the September 2024 release of Visual Studio Code. There are many updates in this version that we hope you\\'ll like, some of the key highlights include:\\n\\n* [Find in Explorer](#find-in-explorer) - Quickly find files in the Explorer view with the improved Find control.\\n* [Source Control Graph](#source-control) - More filtering options and interactivity in the Source Control Graph.\\n* [Python test coverage](#python) - Run Python tests with coverage and get rich results in the editor.\\n* [ESM](#esm-is-shipping-for-vs-code) - Faster VS Code startup thanks to the migration to ESM.\\n* [Account preference](#change-an-extensions-account-preference) - Specify which account to use for an extension.\\n* [Copilot in Native REPL](#inline-chat-and-completions-in-python-native-repl) - Get code completions and Inline Chat in the Native REPL.\\n* [Improved chat context](#drag-and-drop-files-to-add-chat-context) - Drag & drop files or use IntelliSense for more relevant chat context.\\n* [Test environment setup](#automated-test-setup-override) - Get help with setting up a test framework for your workspace.\\n\\n>If you\\'d like to read these release notes online, go to [Updates](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) on [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).\\n**Insiders:** Want to try new features as soon as possible? You can download the nightly [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) build and try the latest updates as soon as they are available.\\n\\n## GitHub Copilot\\n\\n### Switch language models in chat\\n\\nPreviously, we announced that you can [sign up for early access to OpenAI o1 models](https://github.com/o1-waitlist-signup). Once you have access, you will have a Copilot Chat model picker control in Copilot Chat in VS Code to choose which model version to use for your chat conversations.\\n\\n![Copilot model picker control in the Chat view enables switching to another language model.](./images/1_94/copilot-model-picker.png)\\n\\n### GPT-4o in Inline Chat\\n\\nWe\\'ve upgraded Copilot Inline Chat to GPT-4o, to give you faster, more accurate, and higher-quality code and explanations when you use Chat in the editor.\\n\\n### Public code matching in chat\\n\\nYou can allow GitHub Copilot to return code that could match publicly available code on GitHub.com. When this functionality is enabled for your [organization subscription](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/setting-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#policies-for-suggestion-matching) or [personal subscription](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-policies-as-an-individual-subscriber#enabling-or-disabling-suggestions-matching-public-code), Copilot code completions already provided you with details about the matches that were detected. We now show you these matches for public code in Copilot Chat as well.\\n\\nIf this is enabled for your organization or subscription, you might see a message at the end of the response with a **View matches** link. If you select the link, an editor opens that shows you the details of the matching code references with more details.\\n\\n![Chat code referencing example.](images/1_94/code-references.png)\\n\\nGet more information about [code referencing in GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/code-referencing-now-generally-available-in-github-copilot-and-with-microsoft-azure-ai/) on the GitHub Blog.\\n\\n### File suggestions in chat\\n\\nIn chat input fields, you can now type `#<filename>` to get file name suggestions and quickly attach them to your prompt as context. This works in chat locations that support file attachments, such as the Chat view, Quick Chat, Inline Chat, and Notebook Chat.\\n\\n<video src=\"images/1_94/chat-file-complete.mp4\" title=\"File suggestions when typing #filename\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>\\n\\n### Improved file links in chat responses\\n\\nWe\\'ve improved the rendering of any workspace file paths that are mentioned in Copilot responses. These paths are very common when  you ask [`@workspace`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_workspace) questions.\\n\\nThe first thing you\\'ll notice, is that paths to workspace files now include a file icon. This enables you to easily distinguish them in the chat response. The file icon is based on your current [file icon theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_file-icon-themes).\\n\\n![Paths to workspace files in the response now render using file icons.](images/1_94/copilot-path-overview.png)\\n\\nThese paths are interactive links, so just select them to open the corresponding file. You can even use drag and drop to open the file in a new editor group, or insert it into a text editor by holding `kbstyle(Shift)` before dropping.\\n\\n<video src=\"images/1_94/copilot-path-dnd.mp4\" title=\"Dragging and dropping a workspace file from copilot into the editor\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>\\n\\nBy default, these links only show the file name but you can hover over them to see the full file path.\\n\\n![Hovering over a workspace path to see the full workspace path.](images/1_94/copilot-path-hover.png)\\n\\nYou can also right-click on one of these paths to open a context menu with additional commands, such as copying a relative path to the resource, or revealing the file in your operating system\\'s file explorer.\\n\\n![The context menu for a workspace path in chat provides options to open the file or copy its path.](images/1_94/copilot-path-right-click.png)\\n\\nWe plan to further improve workspace path rendering in the coming iterations, as well as make similar improvements to symbol names in responses.\\n\\n### Drag and drop files to add chat context\\n\\nYou can now easily attach additional files as context for a chat prompt by dragging files or editor tabs from the workbench directly into chat. For Inline Cat, hold `kbstyle(Shift)` and drop a file to add it as context instead of opening it in the editor.\\n\\n<video src=\"images/1_94/copilot-attach-dnd.mp4\" title=\"Dragging files and editors into chat\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>\\n\\n### File attachments included in history\\n\\nThere are multiple ways to attach a file or editor selection as relevant context to your chat request. Previously, this context was added only for the current request and was not included in the history of follow-on requests. Now, these attachments are kept in history, so that you can keep referring to them without having to reattach them.\\n\\n![Chat conversation shows that Copilot keeps track of attached files across multiple prompts.](images/1_94/file-attachment.png)\\n\\n### Inline Chat and completions in Python native REPL\\n\\nThe native REPL editor, used by the Python extension, now supports Copilot Inline Chat and code completions directly in the input box.\\n\\n<video src=\"images/1_94/copilot-in-REPL.mp4\" title=\"Using Copilot Inline Chat in the native REPL editor\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>\\n\\n### Accept and run generated code in notebook\\n\\nWhen you use Copilot Inline Chat to generate code in a notebook, you can now accept and directly run the generated code from Inline Chat.\\n\\n<video src=\"images/1_94/notebook-accept-run.mp4\" title=\"Accept and run generated code directly from Inline Chat\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>\\n\\n### Attach variables in notebook chat\\n\\nWhen you use Copilot in a notebook, you can now attach variables from the Jupyter kernel in your requests. Adding variables gives you more precise control over the context for your chat request, so that you get more relevant responses from Copilot.\\n\\nEither type `#`, followed by the variable name, or use the 📎 control (`kb(workbench.action.chat.attachContext)`) in Inline Chat to add a context variable.\\n\\n<video src=\"images/1_94/notebook-kernel-variable.mp4\" title=\"Attach a context variable by using `#` in a notebook chat request\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>\\n\\n### Refreshed chat user experience\\n\\nWe\\'ve refreshed the Chat view with a clean new welcome experience, and we\\'ve updated the layout of the chat input area. You can now use the `@` button to easily find the list of available chat participants and slash commands, both the built-in ones and chat participants from extensions that you\\'ve installed. You can also still find participants and slash commands by typing `/` or `@` in the chat input box.\\n\\n![Updated Chat view welcome experience.](images/1_94/chat-welcome.png)\\n\\n### Semantic search results (Preview)\\n\\n**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.search.semanticTextResults)`\\n\\nThe Search view enables you to perform an exact search across your files. We have now added functionality to the Search view that uses Copilot to give search results that are semantically relevant.\\n\\n<video controls src=\"./images/1_94/semantic-search-in-search-view.mp4\" title=\"Semantic Search in Search View\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>\\n\\nThis functionality is still in preview and by default, the setting is not enabled. Try it out and let us know what you think!\\n\\n### Fix test failure (Preview)\\n\\n**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.fixTestFailure.enabled)`\\n\\nWe\\'ve added specialized logic to help you to diagnose failing unit tests. This logic is triggered in some scenarios by the `/fix` slash command, and you can also invoke it directly with the `/fixTestFailure` slash command. The command is enabled in chat by default but can be disabled via the setting `setting(github.copilot.chat.fixTestFailure.enabled)`.\\n\\n<h2 id=\"automated-test-setup-override\"><div id=\"_automated-test-setup-override\"/></h2>\\n\\n### Automated test setup (Experimental)\\n\\n**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.experimental.setupTests.enabled)`\\n\\nWe added an experimental `/setupTests` slash command that can help you configure the testing set up for your workspace. This command can recommend a testing framework, provide steps to set up and configure it, and suggest a VS Code extension to provide [testing integration in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/testing). This can save you time and effort to get started with testing for your code.\\n\\nWhen you use the `/tests` command to generate tests for your code, it can recommend `/setupTests` and testing extensions if looks like such an integration has not been set up yet in your workspace.\\n\\n### Start debugging from Chat (Experimental)\\n\\n**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.experimental.startDebugging.enabled)`\\n\\nIn this milestone, we made improvements to the experimental `/startDebugging` slash command. This command enables you to easily find or create a launch configuration and start [debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) your application seamlessly. When you use `@vscode` in Copilot Chat, `/startDebugging` is now available by default.\\n\\n![A user types /startDebugging flask app port 3000 in the panel chat and is provided with the launch configuration.](images/1_94/start-debugging.png)\\n\\n### Chat in Command Center (Experimental)\\n\\n**Setting**: `setting(chat.commandCenter.enabled)`\\n\\nWe are experimenting with a Command Center entry for accessing chat. It provides quick access to all relevant chat commands, like starting the different chat experiences or attaching context to your prompt. Note that the Command Center itself needs to be enabled for the chat Command Center entry to show.\\n\\n![Chat Command Center button and the drop-down menu with relevant chat actions.](images/1_94/chat-command-center.png)\\n\\n### Improved temporal context (Experimental)\\n\\n**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.experimental.temporalContext.enabled)`\\n\\nWith temporal context, you can instruct Inline Chat to consider recently opened or edited files as part of the chat context. We have improved this feature and invite everyone to give it a go.\\n\\n### Custom instructions (Experimental)\\n\\n**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.experimental.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles)`\\n\\n**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.experimental.testGeneration.instructions)`\\n\\nLast milestone, we introduced custom [code-generation instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93#_code-generation-instructions). We\\'ve further expanded this functionality to define **shared instructions** for code generation in a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your workspace. These common instructions supplement your own personal code generation instructions. Enable the code-generation instruction file with the `setting(github.copilot.chat.experimental.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles)` setting.\\n\\nIn addition, you can now define instructions for **test generation** in settings or import them from a file. For example, if you always want to use a particular unit testing framework for your tests. Configure the test-generation instructions in the `setting(github.copilot.chat.experimental.testGeneration.instructions)` setting.\\n\\n## Accessibility\\n\\n### Getting started\\n\\nOur **Help** menu now includes a **Get Started with Accessibility Features** walkthrough, which makes it easier for you to explore and utilize the accessibility options. The walkthrough introduces you to functionality, such as the accessibility help dialog, accessibility signals, keyboard shortcuts, and more.\\n\\n![Get Started with Accessibility Features product walkthrough.](images/1_94/accessibility-walkthrough.png)\\n\\n### Comment accessibility improvements\\n\\nWe have introduced an accessible view for comment thread controls. This view includes the relevant editor context, enabling you to stay focused without needing to switch between the editor and the accessible view. Likewise, the editor context is now provided in the accessible view for the comments panel.\\n\\nWe\\'ve also introduced the **Comments: Focus Comment on Current Line** command that lets you quickly move to the Comments control from the Editor by using the keyboard. There are also new actions to go to the next and previous commented ranges in the Editor: **Comments: Go to Next Commented Range** and **Comments: Go to Previous Commented Range**.\\n\\n## Workbench\\n\\n### Change an extension\\'s account preference\\n\\nIn this iteration, we explored how to improve the experience of changing the preferred account for an extension. For example, if you have multiple GitHub accounts and you accidentally signed in to GitHub Copilot with the wrong account and now need to use the other one.\\n\\nIt\\'s now possible to change that preference after the fact in multiple ways.\\n\\n* **Account menu in the Activity Bar** > **&lt;Your Account&gt;** > **Manage Trusted Extensions** > select the gear icon for an extension\\n\\n  ![Manage trusted extensions Quick Pick, with gear button highlighted.](images/1_94/accountPreferenceManageTrustedExtensions.png)\\n\\n* **Extensions** view > context menu (or gear icon) on an extension that uses auth > select **Account Preferences**\\n\\n  ![Account preferences option in the context menu of an extension.](images/1_94/accountPreferenceContextMenu.png)\\n\\n* Extension detail view > gear icon > select **Account Preferences**\\n\\n  ![Account preferences option in the gear menu of an extension.](images/1_94/accountPreferenceGear.png)\\n\\nChoosing any of these options takes you to a Quick Pick where you can change the account that an extension uses.\\n\\n![The account preference Quick Pick that enables you to select extensions for a given account.](images/1_94/accountPreferenceQuickPick.png)\\n\\nWhen you change an extension\\'s account preference, this sends an event to the extension and it is up to the extension to handle it properly. If you don\\'t see the expected behavior, report an issue going for that extension, so the account preference experience can be handled.\\n\\nAlso, let us know if you have any feedback on this flow.\\n\\n### View folders and workspaces associated with a profile\\n\\nIn this milestone, we introduced a **Folders & Workspaces** section in the Profiles editor. This section lists all folders and workspaces that are associated with a specific profile from a central place. From this section, you can add or modify folders, or open the folder or workspace in a new window.\\n\\n![Folders & Workspaces section in the Profile editor.](images/1_94/profiles-editor-folders-workspaces.png)\\n\\n### Update extensions across all profiles\\n\\nIn this milestone, we introduced the ability to update extensions across all profiles. This is useful if you have multiple profiles and you want to keep your extensions versions in sync. Previously, you had to switch to each profile and update the extensions for that profile.\\n\\n### Warnings in the Extensions view\\n\\nThe Extensions view now shows a warning badge and associated information when there are any invalid extensions or extensions that are disabled due to version incompatibility.\\n\\n![Extensions view shows a warning badge and description about the warning.](images/1_94/extensions-warning-ux.png)\\n\\n### Find in Explorer\\n\\nWe’ve improved the Find feature in the Explorer view to make it easier to search for files in large projects. You can open the Find control in the File Explorer by using the `kb(list.find)` keyboard shortcut. While searching, you can switch between fuzzy matching and continuous matching for more flexible results.\\n\\nNote that some context menu actions are temporarily disabled during searches. Stay tuned for more improvements coming soon!\\n\\n<video src=\"images/1_94/file-explorer-find.mp4\" title=\"Searching for files in explorer find\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>\\n\\n### Release notes\\n\\nWe have a simplified syntax for referring to settings in our release notes (`setting(setting.name)`), which also has the now-familiar settings-gear rendering when displayed in the release notes editor.\\n\\n![Setting URL in release notes enables navigating to the Settings editor directly.](./images/1_92/setting-url-in-release-notes.gif)\\n\\n## Editor\\n\\n### Inlay hint improvements\\n\\nWe have added the `setting(editor.inlayHints.maximumLength)` setting, which controls after how many characters inlay hints are truncated.\\n\\nWe have also revised the updating strategy for inlay hints and now, while typing, they should update sooner but not cause any horizontal movements of your cursor.\\n\\n### Experimental Edit Context\\n\\nThis milestone, we introduced a new experimental setting `setting(editor.experimentalEditContextEnabled)`. This setting enables the [EditContext API](https://www.w3.org/TR/edit-context/) to power the editing experience in VS Code. The adoption of the [EditContext API](https://www.w3.org/TR/edit-context/) has enabled us to fix certain IME composition bugs. Generally we believe it will improve the editing experience in the long term, and ultimately it will be enabled by default.\\n\\nMake sure to reload your VS Code window after enabling this setting to take advantage of it.\\n\\n## Source Control\\n\\n### Source Control Graph view improvements\\n\\nLast milestone, we added the new **Source Control Graph** view. This milestone, we have been working on expanding the functionality available in the newly added view as well as polishing the layout of the view.\\n\\n#### Repository picker\\n\\nWhen you open a folder/workspace that contains multiple repositories, the Source Control Graph view title shows a repository picker. By default, the Source Control Graph view shows the active repository, matching the information in the Status Bar. You can use the repository picker to *lock* the Source Control Graph view to a particular repository.\\n\\n![Repository picker control in the title of the Source Control Graph view.](images/1_94/scm-repository-picker-button.png)\\n\\n#### History item reference picker\\n\\nThis milestone, we have added a new history item reference picker to the Source Control Graph view title. You can use this reference picker to filter the history items shown in the graph to a different branch, or to view multiple branches.\\n\\n![History item reference Quick Pick control to choose one or more items.](images/1_94/scm-reference-quick-pick.png)\\n\\nBy default the history item reference picker is set to `Auto`, which renders the graph for the current history item reference, its remote, and an optional base.\\n\\n![History item reference picker control in the title of the Source Control Graph view.](images/1_94/scm-reference-picker-button.png)\\n\\n#### History item actions\\n\\nThis milestone, we have expanded the list of actions that are available in the context menu for source control history items. We have added actions to create a new branch/tag from a history item, cherry-pick a history item, and checkout (detached) an item.\\n\\n![Context menu for items in the Source Control Graph view.](images/1_94/scm-context-menu.png)\\n\\n#### Source Control Graph settings\\n\\nThis milestone, we have added a set of new settings, so that you can customize the graph:\\n\\n* `setting(scm.graph.badges)` - controls which badges are shown in the Source Control Graph view\\n* `setting(scm.graph.pageOnScroll)` - controls whether the Source Control Graph view loads the next page of items when you scroll to the end of the list\\n* `setting(scm.graph.pageSize)` - the default number of items to show in the Source Control Graph view and when loading more items\\n\\n## Notebooks\\n\\n### Multi cursor support across cells (preview)\\n\\nThe Notebook editor now supports multi-cursor editing between cells with the setting `setting(notebook.multiCursor.enabled:true)`. Currently, this can only be triggered with the shortcut `kbstyle(Ctrl+D)` and supports core editor actions alongside a limited subset of editor commands.\\n\\n<video src=\"images/1_94/notebook-multi-cursor.mp4\" title=\"Notebook multi cursor demo\" autoplay loop controls muted></video>\\n\\n### Diff editor shows document metadata changes\\n\\nThe notebook diff editor now also shows changes made to the document metadata, such as kernel information and cell language.\\n\\n![Notebook dif editor showing side-by-side changes to the document metadata.](./images/1_94/notebook-diff-document-metadata.png)\\n\\n### Collapse unchanged regions in diff view\\n\\nThe notebook diff view now respects the setting `setting(diffEditor.hideUnchangedRegions.enabled)`. When enabled, unchanged code blocks are collapsed by default, which makes reviewing changes in large notebooks easier.\\n\\n![Diff editor shows unchanged code blocks as collapsed.](./images/1_94/notebook-unchanged-region.png)\\n\\n### Notebook serialization in web worker (Experimental)\\n\\nThis release introduces an experimental feature that enables notebook serialization in a web worker. This can help reduce main thread blocking time in the Extension Host process when you work with large notebooks. By default, this feature is disabled but can be enabled by setting `setting(ipynb.experimental.serialization:true)` to `true`.\\n\\n## Debug\\n\\n### Support for data colorization\\n\\nVS Code supports new text styling capabilities from the Debug Adapter Protocol. This enables data in the Variables view, Watch view, hovers, and Debug Console to be colorized via ANSI escape sequences.\\n\\n### JavaScript Debugger\\n\\n#### Improved display of HTML elements\\n\\nWe\\'ve improved how HTML elements are displayed in the JavaScript debugger. Previously, they were rendered as naive objects, which were hard to navigate. Now, they more closely reflect DOM structure, and we take advantage of new colorization capabilities to provide some basic syntax highlighting.\\n\\n![HTML elements are colorized in the JavaScript Debug Console.](./images/1_94/js-debug-html.png)\\n\\n#### Autocomplete of Node commands in launch configuration\\n\\nThere is a new autocompletion helper available in `launch.json` files for command-line applications that are installed in your `node_modules`. This makes it easier to set up debugging for tools like `vitest` or `nest`.\\n\\n#### Cleaner Loaded Sources view\\n\\nWe changed how source paths are structured for Node.js built-in modules, evaluated scripts, and WebAssembly modules to make the **Loaded Sources** view less noisy and easier to browse.\\n\\n## Languages\\n\\n### TypeScript 5.6\\n\\nOur JavaScript and TypeScript support now uses TypeScript 5.6. This major update includes a number of language and tooling improvements, along with important bug fixes and performance optimizations.\\n\\nYou can read all about the TypeScript 5.6 release [on the TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-6/). We\\'ve also included a few tooling highlights in the following sections.\\n\\n#### Detection of some common \\'always true\\' programming mistakes\\n\\nSay you\\'re using a regular expression in JavaScript or TypeScript and write some code like this:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst str = \\'...\\'\\nif (/\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+)?/) {\\n  ...\\n} else {\\n  ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nUh oh! Looks like we\\'ve forgotten to call `.test()` on the regular expression, meaning that the `if` conditional always evaluates to true. That\\'s not what we want.\\n\\nEven though this problem is obvious when pointed out, mistakes like this are surprisingly easy to make and have even caused real bugs in VS Code! Thankfully, TypeScript now reports some of the most common \\'always true\\' errors in your program. This includes testing an `if` conditional against a value that is never value, or a conditional expression where the one side is unreachable, such as `/abc/ ?? /xyz/`.\\n\\n[Check out the TypeScript release notes](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-6/#disallowed-nullish-and-truthy-checks) for more examples and details about how this feature works.\\n\\n#### Region prioritized diagnostics\\n\\nWorking in a very long JavaScript or TypeScript file? You should start seeing diagnostics for type error show up a little faster thanks to region prioritized diagnostics. This means that we try to get the diagnostics for the current visible code and show these first, even if the diagnostics for the rest of the file are still being computed.\\n\\nThis optimization is most relevant for complex files with thousands and thousands of lines. You may not notice any changes for smaller files.\\n\\n#### Improved commit character for JavaScript and TypeScript\\n\\nCommit characters can speed up coding by automatically accepting completions when typed. For example, in JavaScript and TypeScript, `.` is often considered a commit character. This means to type `myVariable.property.`, you can just type `myv`, `.`, `p`, `.` with the first `.` accepting the completion for `myVariable` and the second `.` accepting the completion for `property`.\\n\\nThese commit characters are now computed by TypeScript, which means that they can better take the program\\'s structure into account. We can also continue improving our support for them over time.\\n\\nCommit characters are enabled by default but can be disabled by setting `setting(editor.acceptSuggestionOnCommitCharacter: false)` to `false`.\\n\\n#### Exclude Patterns for Auto-Imports\\n\\nThe new `autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes` lets you exclude [auto import](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-editing#_auto-imports) from specific packages by using a regular expression. For example, to exclude auto imports from the subdirectory of a module like lodash, you can set:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes\": [\\n        \"^lodash/.*$\"\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can configure this by using `setting(javascript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes)` for JavaScript and `setting(typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes)` for TypeScript. For more details see the [TypeScript 5.6 release notes](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-6/#exclude-patterns-for-auto-imports)\\n\\n## Remote Development\\n\\nThe [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.\\n\\nHighlights include:\\n\\n* Attach to a Kubernetes container over SSH/Tunnel\\n* Manually specify GPU availability\\n\\nYou can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_94.md).\\n\\n## Contributions to extensions\\n\\n### Python\\n\\n#### Run tests with coverage\\n\\nYou can now run Python tests with coverage in VS Code! To run tests with coverage, select the coverage run icon in the Test Explorer or “Run with coverage” from any menu you normally trigger test runs from. The Python extension will run coverage by using the [`pytest-cov`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) plugin if you are using pytest, or with [`coverage.py`](http://coverage.py/) for unittest.\\n\\nOnce the coverage run is complete, lines are highlighted in the editor for line level coverage. These can be closed and re-opened via the Run Results panel in the bottom, where it says \"Close Test Coverage\" or \"View Test Coverage\" under the most recent test run. Additionally, a Test Coverage tab appears below the Testing tab in the Test Explorer, also with a beaker icon, which you can also navigate to with **Testing: Focus on Test Coverage View** in Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`). On this panel you can view line and branch coverage metrics for each file and folder in your workspace.\\n\\nFor more information on running Python tests with coverage, see our [Python documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing#_run-tests-with-coverage). For general information on test coverage, see VS Code\\'s [Test Coverage documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/testing#_test-coverage).\\n\\n#### Python default problem matcher\\n\\nThe Python extension now includes a default problem matcher, simplifying issue tracking in your Python code and offering more contextual feedback. To integrate it, add `\"problemMatcher\": \"$python\"` to your tasks in `task.json`. A problem matcher scans the task\\'s output for errors and warnings and displays them in the Problems panel, enhancing your development workflow.\\n\\nBelow is an example of a `task.json` file that uses the default problem matcher for Python:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\\n    \"tasks\": [\\n        {\\n            \"label\": \"Run Python\",\\n            \"type\": \"shell\",\\n            \"command\": \"${command:python.interpreterPath}\",\\n            \"args\": [\\n                \"${file}\"\\n            ],\\n            \"problemMatcher\": \"$python\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Shell integration in Python terminal REPL\\n\\nThe Python extension now includes a setting to opt in and out of `PYTHONSTARTUP` script, which runs before you type `python` or any other way to launch the Python REPL in the terminal. If you opt in, you can use features from terminal shell integrations, such as command decorations, re-run command, run recent commands, if they are in Mac or Linux. You can enable this via setting `setting(python.terminal.shellIntegration.enabled:true)`.\\n\\n#### Pylance Language Server Mode\\n\\nThere\\'s a new setting `setting(python.analysis.languageServerMode)` that enables you to choose between our current IntelliSense experience or a lightweight one that is optimized for performance.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t require the full breadth of IntelliSense capabilities and prefer Pylance to be as resource-friendly as possible, you can set `setting(python.analysis.languageServerMode)` to `light`. Otherwise, to continue with the experience you have with Pylance today, you can set it to `default`.\\n\\nThis new functionality overrides the default values of the following settings:\\n\\n| Setting                           | `light` mode   | `default` mode   |\\n| :----------------------------- | :--------- | :--------- |\\n| \"python.analysis.exclude\"                 | [\"**\"]      | []         |\\n| \"python.analysis.useLibraryCodeForTypes\"    | false       | true       |\\n| \"python.analysis.enablePytestSupport\"       | false       | true       |\\n| \"python.analysis.indexing\"                 | false       | true       |\\n\\nThe settings above can still be changed individually to override the default values.\\n\\n### GitHub Pull Requests\\n\\nThere has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which enables you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Review the [changelog for the 0.98.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0980) release of the extension to learn about the highlights.\\n\\n## Extension Authoring\\n\\n### Remove custom allocator in the desktop app\\n\\nIn this version, we have removed the custom allocator that was added in version 1.78 to the desktop application extension host. This custom allocator acts as a bridge for supporting V8 sandbox incompatible Node.js native addons that are built against the Electron runtime. You can refer to this [tracking issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/202385#issuecomment-2367174453) for additional context.\\n\\nWe have ensured that the top 5000 extensions are unaffected by this change. If your extension or a dependency of your extension is affected by this change, you can try the following remediation suggestions:\\n\\n* If your extension uses [n-api](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html) then the status `napi_no_external_buffers_allowed` will be returned when using external array buffers. In which case, you can switch to use the copy version of the API [napi_create_buffer_copy](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html#napi_create_buffer_copy).\\n* If your extension uses [node-addon-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) then refer to this [document](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api/blob/main/doc/external_buffer.md) for alternative API and compile time settings.\\n* If you want to avoid the performance cost from the copy, you can use the [V8 allocator](https://v8.github.io/api/head/classv8_1_1ArrayBuffer_1_1Allocator.html) to ensure that the buffer backing store is compatible with the V8 sandbox.\\n\\nWe have also added telemetry to identify extensions and native addons that might be affected, so we can proactively reach out to extension authors and offer help where possible. If your extension is effected, and none of the above suggestions work for you, comment in our [discussion thread](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions/1771) and we will gladly help.\\n\\n## Debug Adapter Protocol\\n\\nWe formalized how text can be colorized and styled in the display of variables and output in the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol). Colorization works via ANSI control sequences and require that both the client and debug adapter `supportsANSIStyling` in their initialize request and capabilities, respectively.\\n\\n## Preview Features\\n\\n### Multiple GitHub accounts\\n\\nIt\\'s now possible to be logged in to multiple GitHub accounts in VS Code at the same time.\\n\\nThis functionality is enabled by default in VS Code Insiders. In Stable builds of VS Code, you can turn this on with the `setting(github.experimental.multipleAccounts)` setting.\\n\\nHere are a couple of scenarios in which you might need multiple accounts:\\n\\n* Use *Account1* for Settings Sync and *Account2* for the GitHub Pull Request extension\\n* Use *Account1* for the GitHub extension (to push) and *Account2* for GitHub Copilot\\n\\nTo use this functionality, simply trigger a log in action (either with a built-in feature like Settings Sync or with an extension), and you\\'ll be given the option to log in to a different account. This feature also pairs nicely with the new [Account Preference Quick Pick](#change-an-extensions-account-preference) should you need to change the account at a later stage.\\n\\nWhile most things should just continue to work with your existing extensions, some behaviors might not play perfectly nice with this multi-account world just yet. If you think there\\'s room for improvement, do open an issue on those extensions. With the help of the relatively new `vscode.authentication.getAccounts(\\'github\\')` API, extensions have a lot of power to handle multiple accounts.\\n\\nNext iteration, we are planning on turning this feature on by default for all users.\\n\\n### MSAL-based Microsoft Authentication\\n\\nWe have been moving towards having our Microsoft Authentication stack use [MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library)](http://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js). It\\'s been a huge undertaking, but we have made great progress in this iteration. This work spans all VS Code clients, so that includes VS Code and [VS Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev).\\n\\n* For vscode.dev, we have enabled the browser-based `MSAL.js` for all Microsoft authentication requests. In other words, vscode.dev is now entirely on MSAL.\\n\\n* For VS Code, the desktop client, we have this feature behind a setting, `setting(microsoft.useMsal)`. It\\'s behind a setting for now, as we plan on moving towards [the broker flow](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/brokering.md), which would enable VS Code to use the authentication state of the operating system. So, to prevent as little interruption as possible, we will do that work first before enabling this widely. That said, if you\\'re eager to try this new authentication, you are welcome to try and provide us feedback.\\n\\nYou can see the detailed status of this transition to MSAL across all of VS Code in [Issue #178740](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/178740).\\n\\n### TypeScript 5.7\\n\\nThis release includes initial support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.7 release. Check out the [TypeScript 5.7 plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/59905) for details.\\n\\nTo start using preview builds of TypeScript 5.7, install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).\\n\\n## Proposed APIs\\n\\n### Tools for language models\\n\\nWe continue to iterate on our `LanguageModelTool` API. The API comes with two major parts:\\n\\n1. The ability for extensions to register a *tool*. A tool is a piece of functionality that is meant to be used by language models. For example, reading the Git history of a file.\\n\\n2. The mechanics for language models to support tools, such as extensions passing tools when making a request, language models requesting a tool invocation, and extensions communicating back the result of a tool invocation.\\n\\nIn this milestone, we added the ability for tools to request user confirmation before running. This is helpful for tools that may have some side-effect.\\n\\nTake a look at [issue #213274](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/213274) for more details or to give us feedback.\\n\\n> **Note**: The API is still under active development, and things will change.\\n\\n## Engineering\\n\\n### ESM is shipping for VS Code\\n\\nWe are finally shipping our ESM work in VS Code Stable releases. That means that all layers of VS Code core (electron, node.js, browser, workers) use the `import` and `export` syntax in JavaScript for module loading and exporting. All usages of our legacy AMD loader are disabled and will be removed as part of our debt week in October.\\n\\nThe move to ESM massively improves startup performance. For one, a lot of AMD overhead is removed, but then the main workbench bundle size is also reduced by more than 10%:\\n\\n![Graph showing the trend of the main bundle load time, showing a large drop after introducing ESM.](images/1_94/esm.png)\\n\\nNow that we are fully converted to ESM, we plan to improve our engineering system for VS Code. With ESM, a lot of modern tooling will work for us and we are very excited to share more details about this in the near future.\\n\\n> **Note**: extensions are not impacted by this change and not loaded via ESM, please see [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/130367](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/130367) for details.\\n\\n### Use NPM as default package manager\\n\\nBeginning of September 2024, we have completed the [switch from yarn to npm](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/196795) for package management in the [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repo. This decision was based on the specific requirements of VS Code and center around these criteria:\\n\\n* Performance: we initially moved to yarn because of performance reasons and npm can now also meet our requirements\\n* Security: we make our supply chain more secure by limiting exposure and reducing the number of tools we depend upon\\n\\n## Notable fixes\\n\\n* [226401](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/226401) fileWatcher keeps consuming CPU at 200%+\\n* [10054](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/10054) [WSL]: Ports tab incorrectly reports Ports in WSL being forwarded to local when `localhostForwarding = false`\\n\\n## Thank you\\n\\nLast but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.\\n\\n### Issue tracking\\n\\nContributions to our issue tracking:\\n\\n* [@gjsjohnmurray (John Murray)](https://github.com/gjsjohnmurray)\\n* [@IllusionMH (Andrii Dieiev)](https://github.com/IllusionMH)\\n* [@RedCMD (RedCMD)](https://github.com/RedCMD)\\n\\n### Pull requests\\n\\nContributions to `vscode`:\\n\\n* [@BABA983 (BABA)](https://github.com/BABA983)\\n  * fix terminal tab selection not work properly [PR #224394](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/224394)\\n  * Register fold import action [PR #227216](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/227216)\\n* [@BlackHole1 (Kevin Cui)](https://github.com/BlackHole1): ci: ensure retry logic consistency [PR #226038](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/226038)\\n* [@Cecil0o0 (hj)](https://github.com/Cecil0o0): chore: rm unreached ignore items when build extensions.

      "{'content': 'See what is new in the Visual Studio Code July 2016 Release (1.4)\\n\\nDuring July, we slowed down feature work in favor of reducing our bug backlog and removing engineering debt. However, we were still able to add some improvements.\\n\\nHere are the highlights:\\n\\n* **Workbench**: Editor actions such as **Open Preview** and **Switch to Changes View** are back on the title bar. IME and Copy/Paste support in the Integrated Terminal.\\n* **Editor**: Better snippet and suggestions control. New **Insert Snippet** command with dedicated UI.\\n* **Debugging**: **Restart Frame** action to rerun a specific stack frame.  \\'Variable paging\\' feature moved into VS Code and available to all debug extensions.\\n* **Extension Authoring**: New \\'move\\' commands to better support VIM gestures. Custom link behavior with the `DocumentLinkProvider` API. Expanded Debug Protocol.\\n\\nDownloads: [Windows](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679/VSCodeSetup-stable.exe) |\\n[OS X](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679/VSCode-darwin-stable.zip) | Linux 64-bit: [.zip](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679/VSCode-linux-x64-stable.zip) [.deb](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679/code_1.4.0-1470329130_amd64.deb) [.rpm](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679/code-1.4.0-1470329130.el7.x86_64.rpm) | Linux 32-bit: [.zip](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679/VSCode-linux-ia32-stable.zip) [.deb](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679/code_1.4.0-1470328389_i386.deb) [.rpm](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679/code-1.4.0-1470328389.el7.i386.rpm)\\n\\n## Editor\\n\\n### Snippets and Suggestions\\n\\nBy default, VS Code shows snippets and completion proposals in one widget. This is not always desirable so we added a new configuration setting called `editor.snippetSuggestions`. To remove snippets from the suggestions widget, set the value to `\"none\"`. If you\\'d like to see snippets, you can specify the order relative to suggestions; at the top (`\"top\"`), at the bottom (`\"bottom`\"), or inline ordered alphabetically (`\"inline\"`). The default is `\"inline\"`.\\n\\nIn addition, we added a new command to insert a snippet, **Insert Snippet**, which displays the available snippets in a dropdown.\\n\\n![snippet insert](images/July_2016/insertSnippet.gif)\\n\\n### Tab Completion\\n\\nThe editor now supports `kbstyle(Tab)` completions. You can enable it with the `editor.tabCompletion` setting. After typing the prefix of a snippet, press `kbstyle(Tab)` to insert it.\\n\\n![tab completions](images/July_2016/tabCompletion.gif)\\n\\nNote that quick suggestions and `kbstyle(Tab)` completion might interfere because the suggestions widget also reacts to `kbstyle(Tab)`.\\n\\nEither disable quick suggestions:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"editor.quickSuggestions\": false\\n}\\n```\\n\\nor remove snippets from the suggest widget:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"editor.snippetSuggestions\": \"none\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Workbench\\n\\n### Editor Actions\\n\\nWhen we added Tabs (tabbed headings), we put editor actions (**Switch to Changes View**, **Open Preview**) into the context menu to gain some space. User feedback was clear that this made the actions much harder to discover and so we have added them back to the title header.\\n\\n![Menu Group Sorting](images/July_2016/editor-actions-title.png)\\n\\n### Drag and Drop\\n\\nYou can now drag and drop Tabs (tabbed headings) across windows. You can now also drop a folder into VS Code to open it.\\n\\n### Git commit message template\\n\\nIf you have a message template configured in your Git settings, then the Git view in VS Code will show that message in the commit message box by default. Thanks to [William Raiford](https://github.com/bill-mybiz) for contributing this feature.\\n\\n### Faster Quick Open\\n\\nWe made the first steps in improving the performance of **Quick Open**, particularly for large workspaces such as [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org). On Mac (`kbstyle(⌘+P)`) and on Linux (`kbstyle(Ctrl+P)`), **Quick Open** on a Chromium workspace now takes less than half the time it took before. On Windows (`kbstyle(Ctrl+P)`), it originally took twice as long as on Mac and now it is just as fast. We are not finished, expect more performance gains in the next iteration.\\n\\n### Integrated Terminal\\n\\nThe integrated terminal had several changes related to polish and compatibility this release:\\n\\n- **IME support**: Input Method Editor (IME) support has been implemented, allowing input of CJK and Indic characters.\\n\\n  ![IME support in Visual Studio Code](images/July_2016/terminal_ime.png)\\n\\n- **Copy and paste support on Windows and Linux**: Proper copy and paste support has arrived for Windows and Linux within the terminal. The default keybindings are `kb(workbench.action.terminal.copySelection)` and `kb(workbench.action.terminal.paste)` respectively. Note that these command keybindings are not assigned by default on Mac but you can easily add [your own keybindings](/docs/getstarted/keybindings.md).\\n- **Context menu**: A right-click context menu has been added with the options **New Terminal**, **Copy** and **Paste**.\\n- **Accessibility**: It\\'s now possible to escape focus in the terminal by pressing `kb(editor.action.toggleTabFocusMode)` to enable `kbstyle(Tab)` focus mode, just like in the editor. When this mode is enabled, `kbstyle(Tab)` and `kbstyle(Shift+Tab)` will not be passed to the terminal but instead change the element that is being focused.\\n\\n## Languages\\n\\n### JSON completions\\n\\nThere has been some small improvements for the JSON completions:\\n\\n- In schema based JSON documents, we offer completions for empty arrays, objects and string if we know the type of a property but the schema doesn\\'t describe any defaults.\\n- Completion support for the `$schema` property and values.\\n\\n## Debugging\\n\\n### Restart Frame\\n\\nVS Code now supports restarting execution at a stack frame. This can be useful in situations where you have found a problem in your source code and you want to rerun a small portion of the code with modified input values. Stopping and then restarting the full debug session can be very time-consuming. The **Restart Frame** action allows you to re-enter the current function after you have changed variables with the **Set Value** action:\\n\\n![Restart Frame](images/July_2016/restartFrame.gif)\\n\\nNote that **Restart Frame** won\\'t unroll any state changes, so it may not always work as expected.\\n\\n**Restart Frame** is only available if the underlying debug extension supports it and currently only VS Code\\'s built-in Node.js debugging does. Make sure to use a Node.js version >= 5.11 since earlier versions do not work in all situations.\\n\\n### Variable Paging\\n\\nPreviously VS Code expected that large data structures like arrays were broken into \"chunks\" in a debug extension and consequently only a few debug extensions supported this useful feature. With this release, we have moved this functionality into the VS Code debugger front-end so that all debug extensions can easily benefit from this in the future.\\n\\n![Variable Paging](images/July_2016/variablePaging.png)\\n\\nSee section \"Debug Protocol Changes\" below for details of how a debug extension can make use of this.\\n\\n### Double Click Debug Toolbar Centers\\n\\nDouble clicking on the Debug view toolbar drag icon will center the Debug toolbar. This makes it easy to restore the default state.\\n\\n## Extension Authoring\\n\\n### New settings to replace deprecated __characterPairSupport and __electricCharacterSupport.\\n\\nThe deprecated configuration settings can now both be replaced by the `autoClosingPairs` setting in the language-configuration.json file in your extension. See [#9281](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/9281) for detailed instructions.\\n\\n### Editor Commands\\n\\nIn order to allow the [VIM extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) to make good progress on their [roadmap](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) particularly on up-and-down motion and `kbstyle(Tab)` related commands, we added the following editor APIs:\\n\\n- **Move cursor:** Moves the cursor to different logical positions in the editor - See [9143](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/9143).\\n\\n```javascript\\ncommands.executeCommand(\\'cursorMove\\', {to: \\'up\\', by: \\'wrappedLine\\', value: \\'2\\'})\\n```\\n\\n- **Move active editor:** Moves the active editor across groups or across Tabs within a group - See [8234](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8234#issuecomment-234573410).\\n\\n```javascript\\ncommands.executeCommand(\\'moveActiveEditor\\', {to: \\'left\\', by: \\'tab\\', value: \\'3\\'})\\n```\\n\\n### Sorting of groups\\n\\nLast milestone, we added support to contribute menu items to different places in the editor. This milestone we refined sorting of groups. They are now sorted in lexicographical order with the following defaults/rules.\\n\\nThe context menu of the editor has these default:\\n\\n* `navigation` - The `navigation` group comes first in all cases.\\n* `1_modification` - This group comes next and contains commands that modify your code.\\n* `9_cutcopypaste` - The last default group with the basic editing commands.\\n\\n![Menu Group Sorting](images/July_2016/groupSorting.png)\\n\\nYou can add menu items to these groups or add new groups of menu items in between, below, or above. In this release, only the editor context menu allows this grouping control but it will soon be available for the editor title menu and the explorer context menu as well.\\n\\n### DocumentLinkProvider API\\n\\nVS Code has a built in link detector that finds `http`, `https`, and `file` links to make them clickable in the editor. We have added new API that allows extension writers to add custom link detection logic. Implement a `DocumentLinkProvider` and use the [`registerDocumentLinkProvider`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3814) function to register it with the editor.\\n\\n### Debug Extension Authoring: Additions to the Debug Protocol\\n\\nThe [debug protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/main/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts) has been extended in the following areas (and VS Code already provides the corresponding UI):\\n\\n* **Restart Frame**: If a debug adapter returns the capability `supportsRestartFrame`, VS Code shows a **Restart Frame** action in the context menu of the **CALL STACK** view and calls the new `restartFrame` request upon execution of the **Restart Frame** action. The `restartFrame` request must result in a `StoppedEvent` so that the UI can be updated for the new location.\\n* **Variable Paging**: \\'Variables paging\\' adds support for paging variables and their children. The debugger UI in VS Code 1.4 uses this to present variables with many children with a better scalable (paged) UI and fetches the children in a piecemeal way. A debug adapter can find out whether the client supports variable paging by checking the value of the `supportsVariablePaging` client capability passed as an argument to the `initializeRequest`.<br>\\nThrough the optional attributes `indexedVariables` and `namedVariables`, the debug adapter can return both the number of indexed properties (e.g. array slots) and named properties of a variable. These two properties can be returned in all places where a `variablesReference` property is returned, that is in the `Variables` and `Scope` data types and in the `evaluateRequest` response.<br>\\nAdditional optional attributes have been added to the `variablesRequest` to give the VS Code debugger UI better control over what children of a variable to fetch. An attribute `filter` is used to limit the fetched children to either `indexed` or `named` and the attributes `start` and `count` are used to further limit the children to a certain range.\\n* **Continued Event**: A debug adapter can now optionally send a `ContinueEvent` to the client to indicate that the execution of the debuggee has continued.\\n* **Source request supports MIME type**: A debug adapter can now set a `mimeType` attribute on the `SourceRequest` response which a client can use to find a suitable editor.\\n* **Variable Type client capability**: A debug adapter can find out whether the client shows the variable\\'s type attribute in the UI by checking the value of\\nthe `supportsVariableType` client capability passed as an argument to the `initializeRequest`.\\n\\n## Notable Changes\\n\\n* [4842](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/4842): Allow to disable drag and drop in the files explorer\\n* [7839](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7839): Sometimes SVG icons do not show up on Windows 7\\n* [8788](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8788): Weird tabs auto scrolling behaviour\\n* [8704](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8704): Deleting folder containing dirty files closes dirty editors\\n* [8617](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8617): Run selected text in active terminal is not running the selected text on Windows\\n* [8219](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8219): Lines containing unicode characters in integrated terminal differ in height\\n* [9010](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/9010): Global search and replace: Support regular expression variables in replace\\n\\nThese are the [closed bugs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22July+2016%22+is%3Aclosed) and these are the [closed feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2016%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature-request) for the 1.4 update.\\n\\n## Thank You\\n\\nLast but certainly not least, a big *__Thank You!__* to the following folks that helped to make VS Code even better:\\n\\n* [Lucian Wischik (@ljw1004)](https://github.com/ljw1004): Fix small typo [PR vscode-languageserver-node-example#17](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node-example/pull/17)\\n* [Markus Westerlind (@Marwes)](https://github.com/Marwes): DidOpenTextDocumentParams does not extend TextDocumentIdentifier [PR language-server-protocol#36](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/pull/36)\\n* [Eshwar Andhavarapu (@gontadu)](https://github.com/gontadu): Added more T-SQL keywords [PR #9469](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/9469)\\n* [Pouya Kary (@pmkary)](https://github.com/pmkary): Added missing \"rem\" unit [PR #9497](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/9497)\\n* [xzper (@f111fei)](https://github.com/f111fei):\\n  * Fix extracting zip file [PR #7599](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/7599)\\n  * Fix installing extension by dropping [PR #8786](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/8786)\\n  * Fix debounceEvent [PR #9186](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/9186)\\n* [Sorin Iclanzan (@iclanzan)](https://github.com/iclanzan): Fix sensitivity not always being applied.

We\\'ve made some big changes to Extension management (dedicated Extensions View) and added Tabs (tabbed editor panes). Other new features include global Search and Replace, improved Drag and Drop and optional indentation guides. All of this along with enhancements to existing features like the Integrated Terminal and delivering a set of important bug fixes.\\n\\nHere are the highlights:\\n\\n* **Tabs**: Tabbed editor panes allow you to quickly navigate to your files and organize your workbench.\\n* **Extensions**: New in-product Extensions View to quickly find, install and manage your extensions.\\n* **Workbench**: Enhanced Drag and Drop, Preview Editors to conserve your editor panes, and multiple Integrated Terminals.\\n* **Editor**: Global Search and Replace, Indent Guides, Problems panel to view errors and warnings.\\n* **Languages**: Better, more complete Emmet support, Atom JavaScript grammar extension.\\n* **Debugging**: Lots of improvements including support for attaching to running Node.js processes and changing variable values during a debug session.\\n* **Extension Authoring**: A new contribution point for menu bars and context menus. New APIs to open non-text resources and add editor decorator attachments.\\n\\n## Tabs\\n\\nWith this release, VS Code shows open files as Tabs in the title area above the editor. You can move Tabs around via Drag and Drop to organize your files or right-click on a Tab to perform useful file specific actions.\\n\\n![Tabs](images/June_2016/tabs.png)\\n\\nIf you prefer not to use Tabs, you can disable them through the `workbench.editor.showTabs` setting.\\n\\nWhen there is not enough available space to show all files, you will see Tabs overflowing to the left and right. You can always use the mouse to scroll left and right across all tabs. The little overflow icon (see image below) is enabled as soon as there are Tabs outside of the visible view. Clicking on the overflow icon shows a list of all Tabs opened in the group.\\n\\n![Tabs Overflow](images/June_2016/overflow.png)\\n\\nYou can use the new `workbench.editor.openPositioning` setting to control where new editors should open. By default they open to the right of the active Tab, but you can change this to open to the left, or to the beginning or end of all editors.\\n\\n### Open Editors View\\n\\nThe new **OPEN EDITORS** view in the Explorer is the replacement to the previous **WORKING FILES** view.\\n\\n![Open editors view](images/June_2016/open_editors.png)\\n\\nThe **OPEN EDITORS** view is a visual representation of the editor (open file) stacks:\\n\\n* Each editor group with the editors that belong to it is shown.\\n* Clicking on an editor will make it active and open it in the corresponding group.\\n* Top level actions to close all or save all open editors.\\n* Editor level actions to close or save an editor.\\n* Context menu actions provide more refined actions.\\n* It is possible to drag and drop editors between editor groups or from the Explorer\\n\\nYou can hide the **OPEN EDITORS** view by setting the number of visible items to 0, with `\"explorer.openEditors.visible\": 0`.\\n\\n**Note:** Since the WORKING FILES view has been deleted, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6605) to get an overview of the new or changed command identifiers.\\n\\n### More on Editor Stacks\\n\\nAs a preparation for enabling Tabs in the workbench, we revisited how you can interact with editors in VS Code. Many users coming from other tools were confused by some of the editor (open file) behavior in VS Code.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n* Closing a dirty editor (an editor with an unsaved file) did not prompt for saving.\\n* Closing an editor, closed the entire group without revealing the previous editor.\\n* The editor history showed a list of all editors ever opened and not a list of editors you opened in a group.\\n* **WORKING FILES** view in the Explorer was a confusing concept.\\n\\nWith editor **stacks**, we\\'ve tried to address these issues:\\n\\n* You can open up to 3 **editor groups** side by side and each group contains a **stack of editors**.\\n* Every time you open an editor, it is added to the top of the stack.\\n* Closing an editor from a group reveals the editor that was previously opened in that group until the last editor closes and the group hides.\\n* You get prompted to save for dirty editors.\\n\\nUse `kb(workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup)` to bring up a list of most recently used editors of a group for navigation. Use the **View: Show All Editors** command to show a list of all open editors across all groups.\\n\\n![Editor Stacks](images/June_2016/stacks.png)\\n\\nNote that the behavior of editor stacks is independent from having Tabs enabled or not. You will benefit from these changes even if you don\\'t want to use Tabs.\\n\\n**Note:** Due to the large conceptual impact of editor stacks, many command ids have been renamed and new commands introduced. Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6605) that documents the changes. It also provides guidance if you liked the previous behavior and explains how to change key bindings back to the old behavior.\\n\\n## Extension Management\\n\\nWe have introduced a new Extensions View to improve finding, installing, and updating VS Code [extensions](/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md).\\n\\nTo display the Extensions View, click the Extensions View icon or press `kb(workbench.view.extensions)`:\\n\\n![extension view icon](images/June_2016/extensions-view-icon.png)\\n\\nBy clicking on the `...` **More Actions** button, it is possible to show:\\n\\n* The list of currently installed extensions\\n* The list of outdated extensions that can be updated\\n* The list of recommended extensions based on your workspace\\n* The list of globally popular extensions\\n\\nClearing the search box, shows the list of installed extensions.\\n\\nBrowsing through a list of extensions, it is possible to install, uninstall or update them. Clicking on an extension will display the detailed description in the editor area.\\n\\n![Extensions View](images/June_2016/extensions_viewlet.png)\\n\\n## Workbench\\n\\n### Errors and Warning in the Problems panel\\n\\nWith the June release, we now offer a new **Problems** panel, docked at the bottom of VS Code, that shows errors, warnings and other information generated by different sources like language servers, linters and others. In previous releases, we showed the errors and warnings in the quick box at the top of the editor. We have received feedback from users that this made it difficult to review errors and warnings while editing files. The new panel makes it easy to navigate through your errors and warnings and fix them while the editor is still open.\\n\\n![Problems](images/June_2016/problems.png)\\n\\nA filter box is provided to search and filter among the problems shown. You can either filter by type or by text.  For example, \\'errors\\' will filter for all problems of type error. \\'character\\' will filter for problems with messages containing the word \\'character\\'.\\n\\nYou can open the **Problems** panel by:\\n\\n* Using `kb(workbench.actions.view.problems)`\\n* From the **View** | **Problems** menu\\n* From the **View** > **Show Problems** command in the **Command Palette**\\n\\nThe key binding `kb(workbench.actions.view.problems)` that was used to show errors and warnings in the quick open/quick box will now open the **Problems** panel.\\n\\nBy default, the **Problems** panel scrolls and shows problems for your active file. If you don\\'t want this automatic reveal behavior, you can disable it through a setting `problems.autoReveal`. Set `problems.autoReveal` to `false` to prevent your Problems view from changing as you switch between active files.\\n\\n>**Note:** This view is just a representation of markers generated by the language servers or linters or build tasks or any external builders configured in or outside your workspace. You have to configure or customize them appropriately in order to see the expected problems.\\n\\n### More powerful Drag and Drop\\n\\nWith all the work on Tabs, we also looked at improving the Drag & Drop support in the editor. We always allowed you to drop files from outside VS Code into the editor to open the files and now there is a lot more that you can do:\\n\\n#### Drop to Split\\n\\nDrag some files to the left or right area of an editor to open it to the side of that editor. You can either drag from the Explorer or a Tab if Tabs are enabled.\\n\\n![Drop to split](images/June_2016/dnd_editor.gif)\\n\\n#### Drop Feedback\\n\\nWhenever you are dragging files or a Tab over the editor area, you now get drop feedback to indicate the target position of the drop.\\n\\n#### Drag from Explorer and Opened Editors view\\n\\nYou can now drag a file or editor from the Explorer and the **OPEN EDITORS** view to the editor space to open it at a specific location.\\n\\n### Preview Editors\\n\\nClosely related to editor stacks and Tabs are **preview editors**. If you are browsing many files, you might not want to see a Tab opened for each file you open. Preview editors help reduce the number of opened editors (and Tabs) by reusing the current editor. A file will open in preview mode if you open it by single clicking in the Explorer. As long as the editor stays in preview mode, other files will open in the same location as the preview editor.\\n\\nCertain actions cause a preview editor to become a normal editor:\\n\\n* When you modify the contents of a file, the editor will be kept open.\\n* The same is true for when you double-click on a file in the Explorer or inside a Tab or move a file to a specific editor group.\\n\\nPreview editors are indicated using an italic font style.\\n\\n![Preview Editor](images/June_2016/preview_editor.png)\\n\\nWe introduced new settings to control the behavior of preview editors:\\n\\n* `workbench.editor.enablePreview` to globally enable or disable preview editors.\\n* `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromQuickOpen` to enable or disable preview editors when opened from quick box/quick open.\\n\\n### Integrated Terminal\\n\\nThe integrated terminal that was introduced in VS Code 1.2.0 has seen many improvements this release, the primary one being the ability to launch and use multiple terminals at the same time. Terminal instances can be added by hitting the plus icon on the top-right of the **TERMINAL** panel or by triggering the `kb(workbench.action.terminal.new)` command. This creates another entry in the dropdown list that can be used to switch between them.\\n\\n![Multiple terminal instances](images/June_2016/terminal_multiple_instances.png)\\n\\nSeveral new commands were added to aid with management of the **TERMINAL** panel and its terminal instances.\\n\\nThey are:\\n\\n* `workbench.action.terminal.focus`: Focus the terminal. This is like toggle but focuses the terminal instead of hides it, if it is visible.\\n* `workbench.action.terminal.focusNext`: Focuses the next terminal instance.\\n* `workbench.action.terminal.focusPrevious`: Focuses the previous terminal instance.\\n* `workbench.action.terminal.kill`: Remove the current terminal instance.\\n\\nThe ability to run selected text in the current terminal has been added through the `workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText` command.\\n\\nTo use this command, select text in an editor and run the command via the **Command Palette**:\\n\\n![Run selected text](images/June_2016/terminal_run_selected.png)\\n\\n![Run selected text result](images/June_2016/terminal_run_selected_result.png)\\n\\nThe following improvements were also added:\\n\\n* Copy and paste on Linux and Windows is now available using `kbstyle(Ctrl+Insert)` and `kbstyle(Shift+Insert)` respectively. This is temporarily non-configurable until we can [route custom copy/paste keybindings](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/issues/118) to the xterm.js library.\\n* CJK characters should now use the correct width.  Credit for this goes to [@jerch](https://github.com/jerch) in [this PR](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/pull/144).\\n* Performance of the terminal has improved significantly and should no longer perform poorly when running commands that produce large output.\\n* `kbstyle(Ctrl+Left)` and `kbstyle(Ctrl+Right)` now tells the underlying shell to jump over words in the input.\\n* Terminal cursor blinking is now enabled by default. It shares the configuration value with the editor\\'s `editor.cursorBlinking` setting.\\n* A hollow cursor is shown when the terminal is not focused.\\n* Terminal font size and line height can be customized via settings, thanks to a [PR](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/6998) from [@kisstkondoros](https://github.com/kisstkondoros).\\n* Selection has been improved to now select the full line, contain no margin and also invert the text colors.\\n  ![Terminal selection has been improved](images/June_2016/terminal_selection.png)\\n* Arguments can be passed to the terminal shell on Linux and OS X using the `terminal.integrated.shellArgs.*` settings.\\n\\n### Command Palette: File: Open Recent in new Window\\n\\nThe command **File: Open Recent** from the **Command Palette** makes it very easy to quickly switch between previously opened folders or files. Usually the selected file or folder would open in the running instance. In this release, we added support to open into a new window if you select an entry while having the `kbstyle(Ctrl)` (`kbstyle(\\'Cmd\\')` on Mac) key pressed.\\n\\n### Restore Full screen\\n\\nA new setting `window.restoreFullscreen` has been added to open VS Code in full screen if it was previously closed in full screen mode.\\n\\n## Editor\\n\\n### Global Search and Replace\\n\\n[Global Search and Replace](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1690) was one of the most requested features from our users. With this release, we enhanced our Search view to include Replace functionality so that you can replace text across multiple files. You can replace in all files or pick file by file or result by result. You can also exclude results or files and then perform replace on the rest. The Search view gives you a nice preview and clicking on a pending change will bring up the Diff editor view showing the file before and after replace.\\n\\n![Search and Replace](images/June_2016/searchAndReplace.png)\\n\\nReplace functionality can be accessed:\\n\\n* In the **Search View** by expanding the Search textbox\\n* Using `kb(workbench.action.replaceInFiles)`, from the **Edit** | **Replace in Files** menu\\n* Using **Replace in Files** command in the **Command Palette**\\n\\n>**Note:** Since Search has a limitation of showing a maximum of 2048 results, Replace currently has the same limitation.\\n\\n### Indent Guides\\n\\nVS Code can now show indent guides, enabled with the `editor.renderIndentGuides` setting.\\n\\n![Editor Indent Guides](images/June_2016/editor-indent-guides.jpg)\\n\\n### Suggestions for command identifiers\\n\\nWhen authoring the `keybindings.json` file, you now get completions for the available commands.\\n\\n![Command Completions](images/June_2016/commad_ids.png)\\n\\n### Editor Font Zooming with mouse wheel\\n\\nThanks to [@kisstkondoros](https://github.com/kisstkondoros), with [PR #6990](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/6990), after setting `editor.mouseWheelZoom: true`, it is possible to change the font size of the editors by pressing `kbstyle(Ctrl)` (`kbstyle(\\'Cmd\\')` on Mac) and scrolling with the mouse wheel:\\n\\n![Mouse Wheel Zoom](images/June_2016/editor-mouse-wheel-zoom.gif)\\n\\n### Multiline Find\\n\\nWe have added support for multiline Find and Replace:\\n\\n![Editor Indent Guides](images/June_2016/multiline-find.gif)\\n\\n### Emmet\\n\\nThanks to some great support from Denis Malinochkin ([@mrmlnc](https://github.com/mrmlnc)) through Pull Requests and testing help, we are now covering many more Emmet features (Wrap with Abbreviation, Remove Tag, Update Tag, Balance, Toggle Comment, ...).\\n\\n## Languages\\n\\n### Extract CSS/LESS/SCSS and JSON into extensions\\n\\nThe CSS, LESS, and SCSS language support has been refactored to be regular VS Code extensions. As all these languages are based on the same code base, they share the same language server. The language server runs in a separate node process, using the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) to communicate with VS Code.\\n\\n### Extract Markdown into an extension\\n\\nThe Markdown language support has been refactored to be a regular VS Code extension. It uses the Markdown TextMate grammar for syntax highlighting source and renders the Markdown as HTML using the [markdown-it library](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) which implements the [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.25/).\\n\\n### Atom JavaScript grammar\\n\\nAs an alternative to the built-in JavaScript grammar, you can now install the [Atom JavaScript grammar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-atom-grammar). It differs from the built-in grammar in that it creates tokens for variable and function references which, if supported by the theme, can be colorized differently.\\n\\n## Debugging\\n\\n### Moveable Debug Toolbar\\n\\nInitiated by this [user request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/4580), it is now possible to drag the debug toolbar horizontally:\\n\\n![Drag debug toolbar](images/June_2016/dnd_debug.gif)\\n\\n### Changing Variable Value\\n\\nWe now support changing the value of simple variables if a debug extension supports this.\\n\\nNode Debug is the first extension to do so:\\n\\n![Drag debug toolbar](images/June_2016/set_variable_value.gif)\\n\\nA simple variable is a leaf in the variables tree, e.g. a variable, an object property, or an array element.\\n\\n### Show Variable Type on Hover\\n\\nIf a debug extension supports variable types, we now show the type when hovering over the variable name.\\n\\n### Step Back\\n\\nIf a debug extension supports _step back_ we now expose a step back action and button:\\n\\n![Step back](images/June_2016/step_back.png)\\n\\n### OS specific launch configurations\\n\\nInitiated by a [user request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1873), it is now possible to specify OS specific configurations inside a `launch.json`:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n   \"type\": \"node\",\\n   \"request\": \"launch\",\\n   \"runtimeExecutable\": \"mynode\",\\n   \"windows\": {\\n     \"runtimeExecutable\": \"mynode.exe\"\\n   }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Node.js Debugging\\n\\n### Attach to Process\\n\\nNode.js debugging now supports attaching to a Node.js process that has not been started in debug mode. This can be useful if you need to debug a production server that cannot always run in debug mode for performance reasons.\\n\\nIn order to attach to a Node.js process, you specify its _process id_ via a `processId` attribute in an `attach` launch configuration.\\n\\nSince it is not very practical to always having to edit the launch configuration before starting a debug session, we\\'ve introduced a new type of variable that can bind to an interactive UI, e.g. to a process picker:\\n\\n![Process Picker](images/June_2016/attach_to_process.png)\\n\\nHere is a launch configuration that uses the `${command:PickProcess}` variable to let the user select a Node.js process before starting the debug session:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n   \"name\": \"Attach to Process\",\\n   \"type\": \"node\",\\n   \"request\": \"attach\",\\n   \"processId\": \"${command:PickProcess}\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Extension Authoring\\n\\n### Menu Items and Context Menu Entries\\n\\nWe now allow extension writers to contribute to the Explorer context menu (`explorer/context`), the editor context menus (`editor/context`), and the editor title menu (`editor/title`).\\n\\nIt works in two steps:\\n\\n1. Assign a title and an icon to a command using the enhanced `commands` contribution point.\\n2. Create menu items using the new `menus` contribution point.\\n\\nA menu item is defined for a menu location like `editor/context` and must at least specify the `command` to run. To avoid overly cluttered menus, a menu item should also specify a condition under which it shows. Last, an alternative command and a group into which the item is sorted can be defined. Groups are visually separated and there is a special group called _navigation_ which is the most prominent.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"commands\": [\\n    {\\n      \"command\": \"markdown.showPreview\",\\n      \"title\": \"Open Preview\",\\n      \"icon\": {\\n        \"light\": \"./media/Preview.svg\",\\n        \"dark\": \"./media/Preview_inverse.svg\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"menus\": {\\n    \"explorer/context\": [\\n      {\\n        \"when\": \"resourceLangId == markdown\",\\n        \"command\": \"markdown.showPreview\",\\n        \"group\": \"navigation\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n![Menu contribution](images/June_2016/menus-contributions.png)\\n\\nThe snippet above adds an entry into the navigation group of the Explorer context menu **when** the resource is of the Markdown language. *Note* that the URI of the current resource is passed to the command when being executed from a menu item.\\n\\n### Add decorations before and after text\\n\\nNew capabilities have been added to the decoration APIs. You can now add \\'attachments\\' before and after a decoration. Attachments can be icons as well as text content that sticks to the decorated text.\\n\\nAn example are the CSS color decorators attached to color values in the text:\\n\\n![Decorator attachment](images/June_2016/color_decorators.png)\\n\\nDecoration attachments can be defined on decoration types (see the `before` and `after` properties on `ThemableDecorationInstanceRenderOptions`) and fine-tuned on individual decorations (see the `before` and `after` properties on `ThemableDecorationRenderOptions`). You can review these properties in the `vscode` namespace API [reference](/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api.md).\\n\\n### API tweaks\\n\\n* The Uri-class now allows you derive a Uri from an existing one: `someUri.with({scheme: \\'newScheme\\', path: \\'newPath\\'})`\\n* The `previewHtml` command now allows you to provide a `title`.\\n* When previewing html, we expose the style of the current theme via class names of the body element. Those are `vscode-light`, `vscode-dark`, and `vscode-high-contrast`.\\n* Last, there is a new command `vscode.open` to open non-textual resources like images.\\n\\n### Debug Extension Authoring: Command Variables\\n\\nVS Code has supported variable substitution in `launch.json` configurations for some time. This release introduces a new type of variable that is bound to a VS Code _command_. When a debug session is started, all command variables that occur in the underlying launch configuration are first collected and then executed. Multiple occurrences of a variable do not result in multiple execution. Before the launch configuration is passed to the debug adapter, all variables are substituted with the command results.\\n\\nA command is implemented and registered in an extension and its return value is used as the variable\\'s value. The implementation of a command can range from a simple expression with no UI, to some sophisticated functionality based on the UI features available in the extension API.\\n\\nAn example for this functionality can be found in `node-debug`. Here a variable `${command:PickProcess}` is bound to a process picker command. A new \\'Attach to Process\\' launch configuration uses the variable to let the user pick a Node.js process when running the launch configuration.\\n\\nIntroducing a new command variable is simple:\\n\\n* Implement and register the command in your extension (not in the debug adapter).\\n* Add a `variables` section to your `debuggers` contribution point.\\n* Add one name/command-binding per variable.\\n\\n  For example:\\n\\n  ```\\n    \"debuggers\": {\\n      ...\\n      \"variables\": {\\n        \"RemoteHost\": \"askUserForRemoteHostCommand\"\\n      },\\n    ...\\n    }\\n  ```\\n\\n* The variable can now be used in any string typed value of a launch configuration as `${command:RemoteHost}`.\\n* To make the `RemoteHost` variable discoverable for the user consider adding it to the `configurationAttributes` or `initialConfigurations` sections of the `debuggers` contribution point.\\n\\n### Debug Extension Authoring: Additions to the Debug Protocol\\n\\nThe debug protocol has been extended in three areas (and VS Code already provides the corresponding UI):\\n\\n* **Editing variables**: If a debug adapter returns the [capability `supportsSetVariable`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/main/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts#L594), VS Code supports setting the value of unstructured (leaf) variables in the Variables view by calling the [`setVariable` request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/main/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts#L476).\\n* **Stepping backward**: If a debug adapter returns the [capability `supportsStepBack`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/main/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts#L592), VS Code enables the UI for stepping back and will call the [`stepBack` request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/main/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts#L476).\\n* **Show variable type on hover**: If a debug adapter returns the optional `type` attribute for the [`variable` type](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/main/protocol/src/debugProtocol.ts#L741), VS Code will show  the value of this attribute when hovering over the variable\\'s name.\\n\\n### Creating Errors/Warnings from an Extension (Diagnostics)\\n\\nWith the introduction of the new **Problems** panel, we started to work on support for project wide builders and linters. As a first step, we eliminated the automatic clearing of problems when an document is closed. Otherwise opening and closing a document would change the problem set generated by a project wide builder. Due to this change, extensions like linters generating diagnostics are responsible for clearing them when a document is closed. All extension providers generating diagnostics need to adopt to this change.\\n\\nIn a linter that uses the `vscode-language-server` node module, this can be achieved as follows:\\n\\n```typescript\\ndocuments.onDidClose((event) => {\\n  connection.sendDiagnostics({ uri: event.document.uri, diagnostics: [] });\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Monaco Editor\\n\\nThe Monaco Editor is now on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor-core)! It is the VS Code source code editor extracted and packaged as a library that can be integrated in any web application to work in any modern browser. We have created a [playground](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/index.html) showcasing some of the APIs. You can get it via `npm install monaco-editor`.\\n\\nAll further Monaco Editor specific release notes will be available at its distribution [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\\n\\n![Monaco Editor Playground](images/June_2016/monaco-editor-playground.png)\\n\\n### CSS/LESS/SCSS and JSON language services are now available\\n\\nAdditionally, the CSS/LESS/SASS parser and language intelligence source code has been extracted to a separate node module [vscode-css-languageservice](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice) which is used by both the [Monaco editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) as well as VS Code, bringing the same CSS editing experience to the web browser.\\n\\nSame for JSON, where the language service, including the JSON schema validator, were extracted to [vscode-json-languageservice](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-json-languageservice) which again is shared with the [Monaco editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor).\\n\\n## Notable Bug Fixes\\n\\nThe SASS mode language ID has been renamed from \\'sass\\' to \\'scss\\'. If you have customized any linter settings for Sass, just rename the configuration keys from \\'sass.\\' to \\'scss.\\'.\\n\\n* [6316](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6316): Update should reopen all last opened folders\\n* [1210](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1210): Open file dialog should start in the directory for the current active file\\n* [7391](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7391): editor becomes unresponsive all the time since last update\\n  * This fix improves the memory footprint of all colorizers through the use of immutable linked lists for representing colorizer states in-between lines in [vscode-textmate](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate).\\n* [8173](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8173): Noticeable delay opening a Markdown file (source)\\n  * The implementation of a 10x faster hand-written plist parser for TextMate grammars improves the start-up time of all colorizers. We are looking into extracting this implementation to its own node module.\\n\\nIn addition, the following bugs were fixed with the Integrated Terminal:\\n\\n* [#7911](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7911): Terminal lines appears to have margin\\n* [#7684](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7684): Clicking into editor does not properly take focus from Terminal view\\n* [#7458](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7458): Runaway terminalProcess processes\\n* [#6738](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6738), [#7442](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7442), [#7444](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7444): Several issues related to resizing the terminal\\n* [#6743](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6743): Mouse wheel scrolling in integrated terminal only works on filled areas\\n* [#7357](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7357): Invoking the terminal sometimes yields an error \"Cannot set property \\'innerHTML\\' of undefined\"\\n* [#6457](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6457): vim overrides the terminal color scheme\\n\\nThese are the [closed bugs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22June+2016%22+is%3Aclosed) and these are the [closed feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2016%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature-request) for the 1.3 update.\\n\\n## Downloads\\n\\nDownloads: [Windows](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703/VSCodeSetup-stable.exe) |\\n[OS X](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703/VSCode-darwin-stable.zip) | Linux 64-bit [.zip](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703/VSCode-linux-x64-stable.zip) [.deb](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703/code_1.3.0-1467909982_amd64.deb) [.rpm](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703/code-1.3.0-1467909982.el7.x86_64.rpm) | Linux 32-bit [.zip](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703/VSCode-linux-ia32-stable.zip) [.deb](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703/code_1.3.0-1467910772_i386.deb) [.rpm](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703/code-1.3.0-1467910772.el7.i386.rpm)\\n\\n## Thank You\\n\\nLast but certainly not least, a big *__Thank You!__* to the following folks that helped to make VS Code even better:\\n\\n* [Denis Malinochkin (@mrmlnc)](https://github.com/mrmlnc): Emmet -

For extension authors, we\\'ve expanded our debug, TextMate grammar, and command APIs and we\\'ve improved the Language Server Protocol.\\n\\nPlease continue reading for more information on what\\'s new in May.\\n\\n## Editor\\n\\n### Trim auto whitespace\\n\\nThe editor automatically inserts whitespace when you add a new line, based on indenting rules and the previous line\\'s content. Over time, this can result in unnecessary whitespace being persisted in the file. Thanks to [PR #5423](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/5423), the new `editor.trimAutoWhitespace` setting causes the editor to track the automatic whitespace it inserted and remove it if it no longer is needed, for example by typing somewhere else. Please note, this new setting is on by default.\\n\\n![Trim Auto Whitespace](images/May_2016/trimAutoWhitespace.gif)\\n\\n### Select all find matches\\n\\nYou can now immediately select all find results by pressing `kb(editor.action.selectAllMatches)`. This is much quicker than doing a find and replace and leverages VS Code\\'s multi-cursor support. Thanks for [PR #5715](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/5715)!\\n\\n![Find All Matches](images/May_2016/selectAllFindMatches.gif)\\n\\n### Configure Word Based Suggestion\\n\\nWhen a language service isn\\'t able to compute semantic completion (suggestions), VS Code defaults to word based completions. This is why for some languages you see an IntelliSense list with every word in the file. Some folks would prefer to not see this list at all so you can now disable word based completions with the `editor.wordBasedSuggestions` setting.\\n\\n### Resizable Peek View\\n\\nThe Peek view editor that shows for reference search and for previewing declarations can now be resized!\\n\\n![Peek](images/May_2016/peek.gif)\\n\\n## Workbench\\n\\n### Tabs\\n\\n> Note: Support for Tabs is **not** in the 1.2.0 (May 2016) Stable release. You can preview the experiences below by using the [Insiders Release](/insiders) of VS Code.\\n\\n[Tab support](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/224) is the number one [User Voice request](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/293070-visual-studio-code/suggestions/7752519-implement-tabs). While the full implementation will take multiple iterations to fully deliver, we wanted to share progress made during the May iteration.\\n\\nDuring this milestone, we focused on managing *stacks* of open editors. In the picture below, you can see that the left pane has two editors open, the center pane has four, and the right pane has two more. Files listed in italics are *preview* files, they allow you to single click and browse files without cluttering the list of open editors and eventually tabs.\\n\\n![Tabs](images/May_2016/tabsprogress.png)\\n\\nWhen you close an editor the last opened editor in the stack is restored, instead of closing the pane as it does today. In addition, we held a number of UX studies that have resulted in further improvements to the design, including:\\n\\n* Redesign of the overflow icon\\n* Ability to specify if files from **Quick Open** are pinned or previewed\\n* Added a command to turn a previewed file into a pinned file\\n\\nThis work has been checked into main and you can preview it using the [Insiders Release](/insiders).\\n\\n### Integrated terminal\\n\\n[Number two](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/293070-visual-studio-code/suggestions/7752357-integrated-terminal) on User Voice is the request for an integrated terminal, [issue #143](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/143). It can be convenient to have a terminal embedded directly in the tool, initially scoped to the workspace you are working in. You don\\'t have to switch windows or alter the state of an existing terminal for a quick task.\\n\\nWith the May release, we are rolling out the initial version of an integrated terminal. You can open the terminal using `kb(workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal)`, from the **View** | **Terminal** menu, or from the **View** > **Toggle Terminal** command in the **Command Palette**.\\n\\nThe shell that is used defaults to `$SHELL` on Linux and OS X, and `%COMSPEC%` on Windows. These can be overridden manually by setting `terminal.integrated.shell.*` in settings. It should act just like the terminal you\\'re familiar with.\\n\\n![Terminal](images/May_2016/integrated-terminal.png)\\n\\nPlease note, this is an early version of what we want to deliver. Currently VS Code only supports a single terminal and there still are missing features like copying and pasting with the keyboard. Windows 10 users may experience problems getting `cmd.exe` to work. If so, please try enabling the legacy terminal as described in [#143](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/143#issuecomment-221054202). The full list of current bugs and feature requests can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aintegrated-terminal).\\n\\n>**Note:** The **Toggle Terminal** key binding `kb(workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal)` had previously been bound to the **Cycle Between Open Editors** command. You can [customize](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_customizing-shortcuts) the key bindings and change the behavior back if desired.\\n\\n### Removing a specific key binding rule\\n\\nIt is now possible to write a key binding rule that targets the removal of a specific default key binding. With the `keybindings.json`, it was always possible to redefine all the key bindings of VS Code, but it can be very difficult to make a small tweak, especially around overloaded keys, such as `kbstyle(Tab)` or `kbstyle(Escape)`. From now on, simply add a `-` to the `command` and the rule will be a removal rule.\\n\\nHere is an example:\\n\\n```json\\n// In Default Keyboard Shortcuts\\n...\\n{ \"key\": \"tab\", \"command\": \"tab\", \"when\": ... },\\n{ \"key\": \"tab\", \"command\": \"jumpToNextSnippetPlaceholder\", \"when\": ... },\\n{ \"key\": \"tab\", \"command\": \"acceptSelectedSuggestion\", \"when\": ... },\\n...\\n\\n// To remove the second rule, for example, add in keybindings.json:\\n{ \"key\": \"tab\", \"command\": \"-jumpToNextSnippetPlaceholder\" }\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Languages\\n\\n### CSS Variables\\n\\n[Variable support in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables) is a new standards proposal currently in [draft](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-variables/) form. VS Code now supports rich code completion (IntelliSense) for CSS variables as well as Go To Definition, Peek Definition, and Find All Occurrences for variables in the same file.\\n\\nFor example, here we Peek (`kb(editor.action.peekDefinition)`) at the definition of `--bg-color`:\\n\\n![css peek definition](images/May_2016/css-peek-definition.png)\\n\\n## Linters\\n\\n### ESLint\\n\\nThe [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) now supports a \"fix all problems\" command. You can bind the `eslint.fixAllProblems` command to a keyboard shortcut, such as:\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n    { \"key\": \"ctrl+shift+alt+f\",   \"command\": \"eslint.fixAllProblems\",\\n                                     \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### TSLint\\n\\nThe [TSLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) now supports excluding files from linting ([PR #47](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-tslint/pull/47)) as well as quick fixes for a set of TSLint warnings ([PR #40](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-tslint/pull/40)). Thanks for the pull requests!\\n\\n\\n## Debugging\\n\\n### Control opening the Debug Console\\n\\nTo provide greater control over how the internal Debug Console is revealed VS Code, we are introducing the `internalConsoleOptions` setting in `launch.json` (see [#6159](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6159)). This is especially useful if you are using an external terminal while debugging and you want to keep VS Code focused on your code. The possible values are:\\n\\n* `neverOpen` - VS Code will *never* open the debug console\\n* `openOnFirstSessionStart` - VS Code will open the debug console on the *first* debug session\\n* `openOnSessionStart` - VS Code will open the debug console on *every* debug session\\n\\n### Node.js Improved Stepping Performance\\n\\nWe want VS Code to remain lightweight and fast so to improve the stepping experience for programs with a large number of local variables per scope, we\\'ve made the following adjustments for Node.js debugging:\\n\\n* If a scope has **more than 100 local variables**, VS Code no longer automatically auto expands that scope\\n* After you expand the scope manually, only the **first 100** local variables are shown\\n\\nThe scope header will reflect that only the first 100 local variables are being displayed:\\n\\n![100 Local Variables](images/May_2016/many-locals.png)\\n\\nTo track a variable that is not within the first 100 you must add it as a Watch expression or evaluate it in the Debug Console.\\n\\n## Extension Authoring\\n\\n### Debug extension API\\n\\nWe have exposed a `vscode.startDebug` command as an extension API for the VS Code debugger component. With this, a debug session can be started programmatically either by passing the name of a launch configuration file or a complete launch configuration object:\\n\\n```javascript\\n    let launchConfig = {\\n        type: \"node\",\\n        request: \"launch\",\\n        program: \"${workspaceRoot}/test.js\",\\n        cwd: \"${workspaceRoot}\"\\n    };\\n\\n    vscode.commands.executeCommand(\\'vscode.startDebug\\', launchConfig).then(() => {\\n        vscode.window.showInformationMessage(\\'Debug session started successfully\\');\\n    }, err => {\\n        vscode.window.showInformationMessage(\\'Error: \\' + err.message);\\n    });\\n```\\n\\nMore details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/4615).\\n\\n### TextMate grammar injections\\n\\nExtensions can now contribute TextMate grammars that inject new rules into the existing grammars used for syntax highlighting. This makes it possible to add colorization inside string literals or comments, such as highlighting of URLs or TODO markers across multiple languages.\\n\\n```json\\n\"grammars\": [\\n  {\\n    \"scopeName\": \"source.todo\",\\n    \"path\": \"./syntaxes/todo.tmLanguage.json\",\\n    \"injectTo\": [  \"source.js\", \"source.ts\" ]\\n  }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Comparing files\\n\\nWe have added a new API command that allows you to use the diff-editor on two arbitrary resources like so: `commands.executeCommand(\\'vscode.diff\\', uri1, uri2)`\\n\\n### Updated extension samples\\n\\nThere is a new rich extension sample that walks you through _virtual documents_, _eventing_, and using _language features as commands_. Also, the preview html sample was updated:\\n\\n* [contentprovider-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/contentprovider-sample)\\n* [previewhtml-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/previewhtml-sample)\\n\\n### Debug Adapter: Support a \\'One\\' or \\'All\\' mode of operation for controlling threads\\n\\nIn a previous revision of the VS Code Debug Protocol, we had introduced a `allThreadsStopped` attribute on the `StoppedEvent`. With this attribute, a debug adapter can report back to the frontend whether only a single thread or all threads have stopped. Thanks to developer feedback, we learned that a similar attribute is necessary for the `ContinueRequest` too.\\n\\nIn the version 1.9.0 of the [VS Code Debug Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node), a boolean attribute `allThreadsContinued` has been added to the response from the `ContinueRequest`. Using this attribute, a debug adapter can report back to the UI whether only a single thread or all threads are continuing. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6400).\\n\\n### Language Server Protocol\\n\\nThe [Language Service Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-protocol) now offers support for telemetry notifications. Message tracing support has been implemented in the [node client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageclient) to help tracking down problems in the server. It can be enabled via a settings `${clientName}.trace.server` where client name is the name passed when creating the `LanguageClient` instance. For example `eslint.trace.server` for the ESLint linter service.\\n\\n### Command Line Extension Management\\n\\nTo make it easier to automate and configure VS Code, it is now possible to list, install, and uninstall extensions from the command line.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\ncode --list-extensions\\ncode --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools\\ncode --uninstall-extension ms-dotnettools.csharp\\n```\\n\\n## The Monaco Editor\\n\\nAt the heart of VS Code is the \"Monaco\" code editor. You can find the \"Monaco\" editor across many Microsoft properties such as OneDrive, Azure, the TypeScript playground, and even in the F12 tools in IE and Edge.\\n\\nOur goal is to enable anyone to consume the \"Monaco\" editor and host it in any browser. The challenge we have today is that the editor is embedded in the `vscode` repository and the language service extensions have dependencies on client (non browser) technologies.\\n\\nThe first step towards releasing the editor is [an exploration](https://github.com/alexandrudima/monaco-typescript) where the TypeScript language service has been extracted from VS Code\\'s sources and can run on top of the standalone editor API.\\n\\nIn the upcoming weeks we will continue to refine the API and automate the packaging with the goal of making the \"Monaco\" editor public with the June release of VS Code.\\n\\n## Notable Bug Fixes\\n\\n* [959](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/959): Fonts become fuzzy after zooming and scrolling\\n* [1000](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1000): Slow response when system is offline\\n* [2717](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/2717): \"Define Keybindings\" is invalidating keybindings.json\\n* [4541](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/4541): Problem typing in Korean\\n* [5645](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/5645): Slow call stack response for TS repository\\n* [5780](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/5780): Come up with better external terminal defaults on Linux\\n* [6029](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6029): debug doesn\\'t work on node v6\\n* [6151](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6151): The border of scroll bar is ugly, and unclear under high dpi\\n* [6432](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6432): Unity desktop entry not installed immediately after installation\\n* [6525](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6525): Linux CLI fails to open files with spaces in filename\\n* [6530](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6530): source maps don\\'t work if drive letter case does not match\\n* [6593](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6593): Two desktop entries appear on Ubuntu sometimes\\n* [6609](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6609): Change keybinding for \\'fold all\\' / \\'unfold all\\'\\n* [6878](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6878), [6916](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6916): Freeze/Crash when dealing with minified js files\\n\\n\\nThese are the [closed bugs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22May+2016%22+is%3Aclosed) and these are the [closed feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2016%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature-request) for the 1.2.0 update.\\n\\n## Downloads\\n\\nDownloads: [Windows](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/809e7b30e928e0c430141b3e6abf1f63aaf55589/VSCodeSetup-stable.exe) |\\n[OS X](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/809e7b30e928e0c430141b3e6abf1f63aaf55589/VSCode-darwin-stable.zip) | Linux 64-bit [.zip](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/809e7b30e928e0c430141b3e6abf1f63aaf55589/VSCode-linux-x64-stable.zip) [.deb](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/809e7b30e928e0c430141b3e6abf1f63aaf55589/vscode-amd64.deb) [.rpm](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/809e7b30e928e0c430141b3e6abf1f63aaf55589/vscode-x86_64.rpm) | Linux 32-bit [.zip](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/809e7b30e928e0c430141b3e6abf1f63aaf55589/VSCode-linux-ia32-stable.zip) [.deb](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/809e7b30e928e0c430141b3e6abf1f63aaf55589/vscode-i386.deb) [.rpm](https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/809e7b30e928e0c430141b3e6abf1f63aaf55589/vscode-i386.rpm)\\n\\n## Thank You\\n\\nLast but certainly not least, a big *__Thank You!__* to the following folks that helped to make VS Code even better:\\n\\n* [Peng Lv (@rebornix)](https://github.com/rebornix): Add touch screen tap support for reference search.

      "{'content': 'Visual Studio Code 0.3.0\\n\\nThank you for using Visual Studio Code and keep the feedback coming!  Based on your feedback, we added some frequently requested enhancements and provided over 300 minor improvements and bug fixes. This release is available now and is just the start - from this point on, you should expect to see an update roughly every month.\\n\\nSee [how to update](/docs/supporting/howtoupdate.md) to get the bits. Read on for details about the many changes in this release.\\n\\n## Key Bindings\\n\\nBased on user feedback (thanks!) we\\'ve decided to make some key binding changes. If you do not like our changes, you can always change key bindings as described in the [keybindings](/docs/getstarted/keybindings.md) documentation.\\n\\n* The native File Open dialog has been restored to `kb(workbench.action.files.openFile)`. We received strong feedback that using this key for the Code File Open dialog is confusing.\\n* The Code File Open dialog is now accessible via `kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)`. We needed to find a new key for the Code File Open dialog. Since many editors are now using `kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)` for their enriched File Open dialog, we decided to go with this trend.\\n* Go To Definition is now `kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)` (formerly `kbstyle(Ctrl+F12)` on Windows). Visual Studio users suggested to align Go To Definition with Visual Studio. This wasn’t an option in the past when the VS Code editor was running inside the browser, since F12 was opening the developer tools.\\n* `kbstyle(Cmd+Up)` and `kbstyle(Cmd+Down)` now work as expected on the Mac by jumping to the beginning and end of the file.\\n* Format code is now `kb(editor.action.format)`\\n\\n## Command line args\\nYou can now create a new file from the command line. For a file that doesn\\'t exist yet, append the file path to create it. VS Code will open it as a dirty (modified but not yet saved) file in the editor.\\n\\n`code mynewfile.js`\\n\\nYou can open multiple folders and/or files from the command line. Just append multiple folder and/or file paths to open multiple sessions of VS Code.\\n\\n`code c:\\\\myfolder1 c:\\\\myfolder2 c:\\\\myapp\\\\program.cs`\\n\\n\\nYou can also open a new session instead of restoring the previous session.  Use a new switch, `-n` or `--new-window`, if you want to start VS Code without restoring the previous session.\\n\\n`code -n`\\n\\n## Editing\\n\\n### Multi-cursor\\nHere\\'s multi-cursor improvements that we\\'ve made.\\n\\n* `kb(editor.action.addSelectionToNextFindMatch)` selects the word at the cursor, or the next occurrence of the current selection.\\n* `kb(editor.action.moveSelectionToNextFindMatch)` moves the last added cursor to next occurrence of the current selection.\\n* The two actions pick up the **matchCase** and **matchWholeWord** settings of the find widget.\\n* `kb(cursorUndo)` undoes the last cursor action, so if you added one cursor too many or made a mistake, press `kb(cursorUndo)` to return to the previous cursor state.\\n* Insert cursor above (`kb(editor.action.insertCursorAbove)`) and insert cursor below (`kb(editor.action.insertCursorBelow)`) now reveals the last added cursor, making it easier to work with multi-cursors spanning more than one screen height (i.e., working with 300 lines while only 80 fit in the screen).\\n\\n### Comment action\\nWe added these changes for comment actions.\\n\\n* `kb(editor.action.addCommentLine)` now forces adding line comments.\\n* `kb(editor.action.removeCommentLine)` now forces uncommenting lines. (If multiple lines are selected, and not all of them have a line comment, the line comments will still be removed).\\n* `kb(editor.action.commentLine)` toggles line comment as before, but now inserts the line comment tokens aligned with the indentation of the selected code. It also will leave empty or whitespace-only lines untouched. `kb(editor.action.commentLine)` is also more forgiving with regards to selection state when toggling comments in languages which only support block comments, such as CSS or HTML.\\n* Toggle block comment (`kb(editor.action.blockComment)`) is also more forgiving related to selection state when toggling block comments.\\n\\n![Block comments](images/0_3_0/BlockComments.png)\\n\\n### Indentation\\nPressing `kbstyle(Tab)` on an empty line will indent as much as needed to place the cursor at the correct starting position (i.e., not just insert a single indentation).\\n\\n### Shrink/expand selection\\nQuickly shrink or expand the current selection (applies to all languages). Trigger it with `kb(editor.action.smartSelect.shrink)` and `kb(editor.action.smartSelect.expand)`\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of expanding the selection with `kb(editor.action.smartSelect.expand)`:\\n\\n![Expand selection](images/0_3_0/expandselection.gif)\\n\\n### Wrapping control\\nTo improve readability, you can now control how long lines are wrapped and indented with a new setting, `editor.wrappingIndent`, in **settings.json**. The following values are available for `editor.wrappingIndent`:\\n\\n* `none`: When a line wraps, subsequent lines start at column 1.\\n\\n    ![WrappingIndent set to none](images/0_3_0/WrappingIndentNone.png)\\n\\n* `same`: (This is the default.) When a line wraps, subsequent lines start at the same column used by the original line.\\n\\n    ![WrappingIndent set to none](images/0_3_0/WrappingIndentSame.png)\\n\\n* `indent`: When a line wraps, subsequent lines are indented once relative to the original line.\\n\\n    ![WrappingIndent set to indent](images/0_3_0/WrappingIndentIndent.png)\\n\\n## Debugging\\nIn launch configurations, you can now use the `runtimeArgs` attribute. This is useful if you need to pass command-line arguments to Node or Mono (not to the program being debugged).\\n\\nStarting a debug session on Linux now opens a terminal with support for input/output.\\n\\nTypeScript  debugging now supports JavaScript source maps. Enable this by setting the `sourceMaps` attribute to `true` in the launch configuration. In addition, you can specify a TypeScript file with the `program` attribute. To generate source maps for your TypeScript files, compile with the `--sourcemap` option.\\n\\nDebugging is now supported in folder-less workspaces\\nFor example, you can debug when if a folder is not active (e.g., when you choose **File**, **Close Folder** or **File**, **New Window**). VS Code displays a purple status bar when you are in folder-less debug mode.\\n\\nFor exceptions thrown, via the code line marked in red, and for breakpoints, via the status bar.\\n\\n![Debugging UI](images/0_3_0/DebugVisualization.png)\\n\\nHere\\'s other debugging changes we made for this release.\\n\\n* A icon to collapse all variables has been added to the Variables tree.\\n* You can now copy a variable\\'s value to the clipboard from the Variables tree.\\n* Environment variables now work on all platforms.\\n* VS Code no longer inadvertently hijacks an arbitrary terminal on OS X when starting a launch session. Only a terminal previously used for debugging is reused for a new session.\\n* Arguments passed to the runtime or program being debugged can now contain spaces.\\n* `kbstyle(F9)` and `kbstyle(F11)` work again.\\n* Debugging works with UNC paths.\\n* Better error messages are provided if Mono or Node is missing.\\n* Support has been added for F# debugging on Mono on OS X and Linux\\n\\n## Tasks\\n\\nWe have defined three new problem matchers:\\n\\n* `$jshint-stylish`: To detect jshint problems produced by the stylish reporter.\\n* `$eslint-compact`: To detect eslint problems produced by the compact reporter.\\n* `$eslint-stylish`: To detect eslint problems produced by the stylish reporter.\\n\\nMultiline problem matchers have been added to the task system to capture stylish output from several linting tools. You can see an example in [Tasks](/docs/editor/tasks.md).\\n\\nYou can now consistently redefine global properties per operating system and per explicit task. See [operating specific values](/docs/editor/tasks.md#operating-system-specific-properties) and [task specific values](/docs/editor/tasks.md#task-specific-properties) for details.\\n\\nA new property, `suppressTaskName`, can be specified globally, per operating system, or per task, to indicate whether the task name is added to the arguments when a task command is executed. See more details in the Appendix of [Tasks](/docs/editor/tasks.md).\\n\\n## Languages\\n\\n### Rust\\n[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) has been added as a supported language for colorization and bracket matching.\\n\\n### TypeScript\\nThe TypeScript language service has been updated to TypeScript version 1.5.\\n\\n### JavaScript\\nNew options allow you to turn off *all* semantic and syntax checks, useful if you prefer JSHint instead of the VS Code JavaScript validator.\\n\\n* `javascript.validate.semanticValidation=[true|false]` Use `true` to have VS Code report semantic errors (unassigned variables, etc. and *all* lint checks)\\n* `javascript.validate.syntaxValidation=[true|false]` Use `false` to have VS Code report syntaX errors (missing brackets, etc.).\\n\\n### HTML\\nHTML auto closing of tags has now been removed and replaced with smarter IntelliSense on `</`.\\n\\n## CJK wrapping:\\nTo get a better approximation of the Chinese-Japanese-Korean (CJK) character widths, we now measure half-width **m** and full-width **m**. This result is text with CJK characters renders with a monospace font which shouldn\\'t overflow the line and introduce horizontal scroll bars.\\n\\n![Chinese text](images/0_3_0/ChineseLoremIpsum.png)\\n\\n## File Compare\\n**File Compare** applies to files in **Working Files** now too. A new global action, **Files: Compare Opened File With**, has been added to the Command Palette.\\n\\n![File Compare](images/0_3_0/compare.png)\\n\\n## Copy Path\\nTo copy the path of any file or folder in the Explorer, right-click it and choose **Copy Path**.\\n\\n![Copy Path](images/0_3_0/CopyPath.gif)\\n\\nA new global action, **Files: Copy Path of the Active File**, has been added to the Command Palette.\\n\\n![Palette Copy Path](images/0_3_0/CopyPathPalette.png)\\n\\n## Close Folder\\nThe new menu item **File**, **Close Folder** will close the currently active folder and bring the workbench back into the \"empty\" state with a single, empty file opened. (If you haven\\'t enabled Auto Save, you\\'ll be prompted to save any pending changes in the active folder before it is closed.)\\n\\n## File Encoding\\nSet the file encoding globally or per workspace by using the **files.encoding** setting in **User Settings** or **Workspace Settings**.\\n\\n![files.encoding setting](images/0_3_0/FilesEncodingSetting.png)\\n\\nYou can view the file encoding in the status bar.\\n\\n![Encoding in status bar](images/0_3_0/FileEncoding.png)\\n\\nClick on the encoding in the status bar to reopen or save the active file with a different encoding.\\n\\n![Reopen or save with a different encoding](images/0_3_0/EncodingClicked.png)\\n\\nThen choose an encoding.\\n\\n![Select an encoding](images/0_3_0/EncodingSelection.png)\\n\\n## Settings\\nThe JSON parser is now more fault tolerant.  For example, if you have a trailing comma in **settings.json**, VS Code will no longer silently fail to apply your customized settings.  We\\'ll still provide a visual indicator that there is an issue with the JSON. This example displays a red squiggly line on the last bracket, and a red box to the far right of Line 5.\\n\\n![JSON settings errors](images/0_3_0/settingserrors.png)\\n\\n## UNC paths supported\\nWith this release, you can now access Windows files and folders through UNC paths.\\n\\n## Working files watched\\nFiles not inside the opened folder but inside **Working Files** are now watched for changes and updated when changed.\\n\\n## Linux 32-bit\\nVS Code is now available for 32-bit editions of Linux ([download](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615206)).\\n\\n## Other significant bug changes\\nWe also fixed the following items.\\n\\n* [16481](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/16481): Opening files from a UNC folder\\n* [16457](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/16457): Chinese characters not properly rendered on Linux\\n* [16574](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/16574): Encoding issues\\n* [16500](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/16500): $scope auto completes to $$scope\\n* [16514](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/16514): HTML tags are incorrectly auto completed\\n* [16573](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/16573): \"CFBundleIdentifier\" of \"Visual Studio Code.app\" should be changed from \"com.github.atom-shell\" to another unique identifier.\\n\\nFor a list of currently known issues, see our [FAQ](/docs/supporting/faq.md).

      "{'content': 'See what is new in Visual Studio Code 0.5.0\\n\\nThank you again for using Visual Studio Code! With our second update, we have lots to share with you, so much that we\\'ll start with a quick summary for some of the key items:\\n\\n* Several updates to how we handle files, including file and folder filtering in the explorer, opening files via the command line at a specific line number, re-using an existing instance when you open multiple files, ability to control the size of the working files list.\\n* Improved editor options that include support for removing trailing whitespace, improved search patterns with include/exclude filters.\\n* Significant JavaScript updates including ES6 support, jsconfig.json, improved `///` reference management, additional workspace settings\\n* Git enhancements, including an integrated credential prompt, multiline commit message support and improved control over auto-fetch\\n* User-defined snippets support, and more built-in snippets for common languages, i.e., Dockerfiles, Python, and Rust.\\n* Debugger enhancements including watch expressions, and improved Node.js breakpoint and source map support.\\n* Other Stuff: Proxy support, auto-update enabled for Mac and Windows, notable bug fixes\\n\\nThis release is available now - see [how to update](/docs/supporting/howtoupdate.md) to get the bits.\\n\\nRead on to find out about the new features and learn how you can be more productive using VS Code.\\n\\n## Files\\n\\nNew file-based enhancements make it easier to link VS Code into your workflow with other tools, e.g. Unity, as well as improve the overall experience.\\n\\n>**Note:**  In the Editor Options section below, we show how you can hide derived resources in the Explorer, update the size of the Working Files area and exclude files from Search.\\n\\n**New command-line options: -r and -g**\\n\\n* The `-r` (or `--reuse-window`) command-line option forces opening a file or folder in the last active window. This is useful in cases where you want to quickly send a file from the command line into your workspace,  without having to manage new windows each time. This also works with files that don\\'t exist - VS Code will simply open a new file as dirty in the last active window.\\n\\n* The `-g` (or `--goto`) command-line option lets you open files at a specific line and column number. This is useful if you\\'re using another tool in your workflow and want VS Code to open an exact position within a file.<br/>The syntax is:<br/>`code -g file1:<line>:<column?> file2:<line>:<column?> file3:<line>:<column?>`<br/>The `column` value is optional. As shown in the example, you can open multiple files in a single VS Code instance using the desired line and column position. Note that `\"-g\"` switch is mandatory for this feature, since `:` is a valid character in file names on some operating systems.<br/>\\nHere\\'s how to open a file to line 10, column 17:<br/>`code -g c:\\\\mycode\\\\HelloWorld.ts:10:17`<br/>\\n\\n>**Tip:** If you combine `-r` and `-g` you can configure an external tool to open files on a specific line and column into your running VS Code instance!  This was a popular request from the Unity user base.\\n\\n**Additional command line changes**\\n\\nWhen you pass multiple file paths to VS Code, they will all open in the same instance now. If some of the paths point to files that don\\'t exist, VS Code will open new files as dirty.\\n\\nWhen you pass in command-line arguments for the path to a folder, and also a file name, VS Code will open both the folder and file in a single VS Code instance. Previously we would open two (or more) VS Code instances. The usage case is that you want to open a specific file in a folder while still opening the folder in the side bar.\\n\\nNote that you can use absolute paths or relative paths for the folder argument and the file argument. If you use a relative path for the file argument, it is relative to where you start VS Code (not relative to the folder argument).\\n\\nThis example opens the current folder and a specific file, HelloWorld.ts, in that folder (the file will be created as dirty if it doesn\\'t exist).\\n\\n`code . HelloWorld.ts`\\n\\n**Mac dock support**\\n\\nYou can now open files and folders by dropping them to VS Code, even if it is not yet running. In addition, when you drop multiple files on the dock while VS Code is already running, VS Code will not start separate instances for each, but instead will try to open them in one instance.\\n\\n## Editor options\\n\\nWe added more configuration options for files, explorer and search. Access them from **File** | **Preferences**.\\x0b\\n\\n**Patterns syntax**\\n\\nTo support several of the new Search and Editor options, we\\'ve introduced a lightweight pattern matcher.  With a simplified set of patterns we support for specifying match patterns, you can use:\\n\\n* `*` to match one or more characters in a path segment\\n* `?` to match on one character in a path segment\\n* `**` to match any number of path segments ,including none\\n* `{}` to group conditions (e.g. `{**/*.html,**/*.txt}` matches all html and txt files)\\n* `[]` to declare a range of characters to match (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, …\\n\\n**Automatically trim trailing whitespace**\\n\\nBy popular demand, we added the `files.trimTrailingWhitespace` setting that allows you to trim trailing whitespace whenever you save.  This also works with autosave enabled.\\n\\n**Configure the size and behavior of Working Files**\\n\\nTwo new settings give you more control over how files appear in the Working Files area - ideal for larger monitors!\\n\\n* The `explorer.workingFiles.maxVisible` setting allows you to configure the number of visible working files before a scrollbar appears (the default is 9).\\n* The `explorer.workingFiles.dynamicHeight` setting lets you configure whether working files should dynamically adjust its height based on the number of elements inside. Set this to `false` if you don’t want the explorer jumping down when you add new working files. The default is `true`.\\n\\n**Hiding files and folders**\\n\\nThe `files.exclude` setting lets you define patterns to hide files and folders from several places in VS Code like the explorer and search. Once defined, files and folders matching any of the patterns will be hidden.\\n\\n>**Tip:** This is really useful to hide derived resources files, like `\\\\*.meta` in Unity, or `\\\\*.js` in a TypeScript project. For Unity to exclude the `\\\\*.cs.meta` files, the pattern to choose would be: `\"**/*.cs.meta\"`\\n\\n**Hide derived resources**\\n\\nIf you use a language that compiles to another file at the same location of the source file, like TypeScript does to JavaScript, you often don’t want to see the files in the explorer or include them in search results. With the new filtering capabilities, you can easily set an expression to hide those derived files:\\n\\n`\"**/*.js\": { \"when\": \"$(basename).ts\"}`\\n\\nSuch a pattern will match on any JavaScript file (`**/*.js`), but only if a sibling file with the same name and extension, `*.ts` in this example, is present. The result being Explorer will no longer show derived resources for JavaScript if they are compiled to the same location. All you have to do is configure this in the `files.exclude` setting. While we\\'ve used JavaScript for this example, the same technique can be used for other transpiled languages, like Coffee Script or Less/Sass, too.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how JavaScript files are hidden using the `\"**/*.js\": { \"when\": \"$(basename).ts\"}` expression.\\n\\n![Hiding derived resources](images/0_5_0/HidingDerivedResources.png)\\n\\n**Exclude files and folders from search**\\n\\nThe `search.exclude` setting lets you configure additional files and folders to exclude from full text searches and from quick open, besides the `file.exclude` setting. This uses the patterns syntax (discussed below).\\n\\n>**Note:** This is a **breaking change**, as it replaces `search.excludeFolders`, so be sure to update your settings!\\n\\n**Search leveraging patterns**\\n\\nTo let you define powerful patterns for includes and excludes when you run searches, we added glob pattern support to the search box too. You can enable glob pattern search by clicking on the little icon in the include and exclude box.\\n\\nOnce you click on the pattern icon, you have access to the pattern reference.\\n\\n![Search patterns](images/0_5_0/SearchPatterns.png)\\n\\n>**Note:** You can still use wildcards without enabling glob pattern support. Things like `*.js` to search in all JavaScript files still work. Once you enable glob pattern syntax, keep in mind that you need to use `**/*.js` to search across all directories of your project!\\n\\n## JavaScript\\n\\nWe\\'ve made a lot of changes for JavaScript development in this release.\\n\\n**Breaking Changes**\\n\\nA change like this comes with a few breaking changes: We deprecated some advanced configuration settings: `validate.scope`, `validate.baseUrl`, `validate.target`, `validate.module`, `validate.noLib`. We\\'re providing support for  `jsconfig.json` to offset these settings no longer being supported.\\n\\n**Support for ES6**\\n\\nA popular request since our launch has been support for ES6 (ECMAScript 6, the latest update of JavaScript targeting ratification in June 2015). You can expect VS Code to understand the new ES6 syntax elements and their semantics.\\n\\nNote that super-references in deriving object-literals is still on our plate; currently if you try this in VS Code you\\'ll receive a faulty compile error, which you can suppress with the `_surpressSuperWithoutSuperTypeError: [true|false]` option.\\n\\n>**Tip:** A good overview of the new ES6 features can be found here: <https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features>\\n\\n**Projects - jsconfig.json**\\n\\nYou can create a JavaScript project by dropping in a `jsconfig.json` file. It\\'s a subset of [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json), and it allows you to define what files are part of a project, and what compiler options to use.\\nSame as in `tsconfig.json` if no \"files\" property is present in a `jsconfig.json`, we default to including all files in the containing directory and subdirectories. When a \"files\" property is specified, only those files are included.\\n\\n![jsonconfig.json](images/0_5_0/JsconfigJson.png)\\n\\nThis means you don’t need to use `///` references anymore. As the project defines the file set, VS Code just knows what files and symbols are part of your project. As an example, you can just drop a new `.d.ts` file into your project folder and VS Code will pick it up automatically.\\n\\n>**Note:** In the Editor Options section, we discuss how you can hide derived files in the Explorer window, e.g. `*.js` files generated from `*.ts` sources.  In the Debugging section, we discuss support for JavaScript Source Maps and minified/uglified JavaScript debugging.\\n\\n**Shebang coloring**\\n\\nWe improved colorization for shebang `#!`, as shown in the first line here:\\n\\n![Shebang coloring](images/0_5_0/ShebangColoring.png)\\n\\n## Snippets\\n\\nVS Code launched with [snippet support](/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets.md), and we\\'ve added some notable enhancements in this release.\\n\\n**User-defined snippets**\\n\\nTo add your own code snippets, use the newly added User Snippet action available by **File** | **Preferences**. This action opens a language selection dialog. Selecting a language will open the snippets for the file language. Enter your snippets directly in the editor.\\n\\n>**Tip:** Changes are picked up on save (there\\'s no need to restart VS Code).\\n\\nThis is an example of a snippet file:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n\\t\"Node Require\" : {\\n\\t\\t\"prefix\": \"require\",\\n\\t\\t\"body\": [\\n\\t\\t\\t\"var ${module} = require(\\'${module}\\');\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\"$0\"\\n\\t\\t],\\n\\t\\t\"description\": \"Node require statement\"\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nEach property in the object represents a snippet.\\n\\n* `body` is what is inserted when the snippet is selected.\\n* `description` is shown as additional information.\\n* `prefix` is what IntelliSense will use as a label and to filter against.\\n\\nThe body format follows the TextMate template syntax (https://manual.macromates.com/en/snippets), with the following constructs supported:\\n\\n* plain text\\n* placeholders with identifiers `${id: text}`\\n* simple tab placeholders `$0, $1, …`\\n* nested placeholders `${id1:  some text ${id2: nested text} }`\\n\\nWe have also added some more snippets out of the box for Dockerfiles, Python, and Rust.\\n\\n## Git\\n\\nWe updated our Git support by delivering several of the most requested features.\\n\\n**Credential prompt**\\n\\nMany users have reported that the Git tools can be non-responsive.  This is typically a result of the Git action being blocked by an authentication prompt.  With this update, when Git requires credentials you will see a pop-up, prompting you to enter the required credentials.\\n\\n![Credential prompt](images/0_5_0/CredentialPrompt.png)\\n\\n>**Tip:** If you don’t want to always enter your credentials, consider using a [credential helper](https://docs.github.com/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git).\\n\\n**Multiline commit**\\n\\nPreviously, commit messages in VS Code supported only a single line of text.  We now support multiple lines of text in your commit message. (Type `kbstyle(Ctrl+Enter)` to finish the commit message, or `kbstyle(Enter)` to add a new line to the message.)\\n\\n![Multiline commit message](images/0_5_0/MultilineCommit.png)\\n\\n**Multiple file selection**\\n\\nMultiple selection is now enabled in the Git view, meaning you can stage/unstage or commit multiple files at the same time.\\n\\n![Select multiple files](images/0_5_0/GitMultiSelect.gif)\\n\\n**Auto fetch control**\\n\\nThere is now an action to enable/disable Git auto fetch in the dropdown menu of the Git view. This is handy if you don’t have a credential helper and don’t want to get prompted for authentication all the time.\\n\\n## Debugging\\n\\nDebugging is core to the workflow enabled by VS Code, and with this release we support several additional scenarios.\\n\\n**Improved launch.json generation**\\n\\nWe are now consulting package.json for a main attribute when generating launch.json. The result is the generated launch.json is more precise.\\n\\n**Watch expressions**\\n\\nWe added a new debug pane for watch expressions. You are able to add, rename or remove watch expressions from the Debug view. Based on the focused stack frame, watch expressions are reevaluated whenever the debug target has stopped. It is also possible to add an expression to watch using the editor context menu.\\n\\n![Watch expressions](images/0_5_0/WatchExpressions.png)\\n\\n**Ability to edit during debug**\\n\\nThe workbench is no longer in read-only mode when debugging.\\nHowever, VS Code does not yet support \\'hot code replacement\\', so edited code is not automatically picked up by the debugger\\nbut a new \\'Restart Session\\' action helps to improve the experience.\\n\\n**Improved Node breakpoint handling**\\n\\nNode does not parse source files completely on load, rather it delays parsing of closures (e.g. callbacks) until their code is first hit. As a consequence, breakpoints set on callbacks are sometimes not registered for the line requested but instead  register for the next possible line in already-parsed code. To avoid confusion, we now show breakpoints at the location where node thinks the breakpoint is. In the breakpoint view, these breakpoints are shown with this notation:\\n\\n*request line* → *actual line*\\n\\nHere\\'s an example:\\n\\n![Node breakpoints](images/0_5_0/NodeBreakpoints.png)\\n\\nThis breakpoint validation occurs when a session starts and the breakpoints are registered with node, or when a session is already running and a new breakpoint is set. In this case, the breakpoint may \"jump\" to a different location.\\x0bAfter node.js has parsed all the code (e.g,. by running through it), breakpoints can be easily re-applied to the requested locations with the Reapply button in the breakpoint view\\'s header. This should make the breakpoints \"jump back\" to the requested location.\\n\\n\\n**Activate / deactivate breakpoints**\\n\\nYou can now toggle the active breakpoints.\\n\\n![Toggle active breakpoints](images/0_5_0/ToggleActiveBPs.png)\\n\\n**JavaScript source maps**\\n\\nIf generated (transpiled) JavaScript files do not live next to their source, you can help the VS Code debugger locate them by specifying the outDir directory in the launch configuration. Whenever you set a breakpoint in the original source, VS Code tries to find the generated source, and the associated source map, in the outDir directory.\\n\\nIn-lined source maps (a source map where the content is stored as a data url instead of a separate file) are now supported, although in-lined source is not yet supported.\\n\\n**Minified debugging**\\n\\nDebugging minified/uglified JavaScript is now supported.\\n\\n## Other stuff\\n\\n**Output toggling**\\n\\nA new action was added that allows to toggle the output window. When output is not showing, it will just show output. But when output is showing, it will restore the previous editor you\\'d been using. This allows to quickly check the output and then quickly return to the work you did before. The action replaces the previous \"Show Output\" action, so by default the keybinding for output toggling is Ctrl+Shift+U (Cmd+Shift+U on Mac).\\n\\n**Auto-update enabled for OS X and Windows**\\n\\nWith this update, future updates will be automatic for OS X and Windows users (we don\\'t support auto-updates for Linux). If you want to opt out of auto-updates, see instructions [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397).\\n\\n**Proxy Support**\\n\\nHttp requests for package/project/bower.json IntelliSense as well as fetching schemas and for Send-a-Smile now can go through a proxy server.\\n\\nTo configure a proxy either:\\n\\n* Set the `http_proxy` and the `https_proxy` environment variables before starting VS Code.\\n* Set the `http.proxy` user setting.\\n\\n>**Note:** VS Code supports http and https proxies, but not SOCKS proxies.\\n\\n**Notable Bug Fixes**\\n\\n* [16480](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/16480): Git push/pull not working\\n* [16782](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/16782): Fonts Are Blurry\\n* [17223](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/17223): SourceMap debugging doesn\\'t work with inlined source map\\n* [17079](https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/Detail/17079): OS X Poor Scrolling in Explore Sidebar\\n\\n\\nFor a list of currently known issues, see our [FAQ](/docs/supporting/faq.md).

The debugger UI in VS Code 1.4 uses this to present variables with many children with a better scalable (paged) UI and fetches the children in a piecemeal way. A debug adapter can find out whether the client supports variable paging by checking the value of the `supportsVariablePaging` client capability passed as an argument to the `initializeRequest`.<br>\\nThrough the optional attributes `indexedVariables` and `namedVariables`, the debug adapter can return both the number of indexed properties (e.g. array slots) and named properties of a variable.

It can be convenient to have a terminal embedded directly in the tool, initially scoped to the workspace you are working in. You don't have to switch windows or alter the state of an existing terminal for a quick task.  \\nWith the May release, we are rolling out the initial version of an integrated terminal. You can open the terminal using `kb(workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal)`, from the **View** | **Terminal** menu, or from the **View** > **Toggle Terminal** command in the **Command Palette**.  \\nThe shell that is used defaults to `$SHELL` on Linux and OS X, and `%COMSPEC%` on Windows. These can be overridden manually by setting `terminal.integrated.shell.*` in settings. It should act just like the terminal you're familiar with.  \\n![Terminal](images/May_2016/integrated-terminal.png)  \\nPlease note, this is an early version of what we want to deliver. Currently VS Code only supports a single terminal and there still are missing features like copying and pasting with the keyboard. Windows 10 users may experience problems getting `cmd.exe` to work. If so, please try enabling the legacy terminal as described in [#143](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/143#issuecomment-221054202).

The goal of this is to detect the supported debugging protocol(s) of the targeted Node.js runtime automatically and to select the best debugger implementation based on that protocol.

For configurations of request type `launch` and if no `runtimeExecutable` is specified, we try to determine the version by running Node.js from the PATH with an `--version` argument. If the version is >= 6.9, the new 'inspector' protocol is used. For configurations of request type 'attach', we try to connect with the new protocol and if that works, we use the 'inspector' protocol. We only switch to the new inspector protocol for versions >= 6.9 because of problems in earlier versions.\\n- **`inspector`**: forces the node debugger to use the 'inspector' protocol based implementation (aka 'node2'). This is supported by Node.js versions >= 6.3, but not (yet) by Electron.\\n- **`legacy`**: forces the node debugger to use the 'legacy' protocol based implementation. This is supported by Node.js versions < v8.0).  \\nIn the future `auto` will be the default, however since the transition to the new node debugging experience hasn't been finished yet (and we were not brave enough to enable it by default), we continue to use `legacy` for the time being.  \\nBut we would like to encourage you to use `'protocol': 'auto'` in your launch configurations and provide feedback if you experience problems.\", metadata={'Header 1': 'Header', 'Header 2': 'Node Debugging', 'Header 3': 'Node2 transitioning', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_10#Node2_transitioning'}),\n",

Currently the attributes `exceptionId`, `exception`, `breakMode`, and `details.stackTrace` are displayed in VS Code\\'s exception Peek UI.  \\n* **Server mode for debug adapters**  \\nVS Code always supported running debug adapters in server mode. However this was only officially supported for developing debug adapters, not for running them in production. With this release, we are starting to support the \"server mode\" as an official \"run mode\" for debug adapters. Please find the details for how to use this feature in the original [feature request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/22080#issuecomment-286068943).  \\n* **Changed semantics of `StoppedEvent.reason`**  \\nThe semantics of the `reason` attribute of `StoppedEvent` has been changed slightly. Previously, it was specified that the reason attribute is shown in the UI (which has the consequence that the value needs to be translated to different languages). This makes it impossible for VS Code to interpret the `reason` attribute in a robust way. Starting with this release, VS Code uses the new attribute `description` when the \"stopped\" reason needs to be shown in the UI and uses the `reason` attribute to interpret the reason. If `description` is missing, VS Code falls back to the previous behavior.  \\n* **New attribute `presentationHint` for `StackFrame` type**  \\nA new optional attribute `presentationHint` has been added to the `StackFrame` type which can be used to control how the client renders a stack frame in the UI.  \\n* **Usage example for exception configuration API**  \\nThe VS Code [Mono debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.mono-debug) has been enhanced to use the recently introduced `exceptionOptions` attribute on the `SetExceptionBreakpointsRequest` for configuring exception catchpoints.  \\n![Configuring Exceptions](images/1_11/config-exceptions.gif)  \\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug/blob/main/src/typescript/extension.ts#L90) can serve as an example for how to use the debug adapter protocol (DAP) from an extension to add specific functionality that is not provided by the generic VS Code debugger UI.', metadata={'Header 2': 'Extension Authoring', 'Header 3': 'Debug Extensions', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_11#Debug_Extensions'}),\n",

This is a great way to catch common programming mistakes and these type checks also enable some exciting quick fixes for JavaScript.  \\n![Using type checking and quick fixes in a JavaScript file](images/1_12/ts-checkjs-example.gif)  \\nTypeScript can infer types in `.js` files same as in `.ts` files. When types cannot be inferred, they can be specified using JSDoc comments. You can read more about how TypeScript uses JSDoc for JavaScript type checking [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Type-Checking-JavaScript-Files).  \\nType checking of JavaScript is optional and opt-in. Existing JavaScript validation tools such as ESLint can be used alongside the new built-in type checking functionality.  \\nYou can get started with type checking a few different ways depending on your needs.  \\n**Per file**  \\nThe easiest way to enable type checking in a JavaScript file is by adding `// @ts-check` to the top of a file.  \\n```js\\n// @ts-check\\nlet easy = \\'abc\\'\\neasy = 123 // Error: Type \\'123\\' is not assignable to type \\'string\\'\\n```  \\nUsing `// @ts-check` is a good approach if you just want to try type checking in a few files but not yet enable it for an entire codebase.  \\n**Using a Setting**  \\nTo enable type checking for all JavaScript files without changing any code, just add `\"js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs\": true` to your workspace or user settings. This enables type checking for any JavaScript file that is not part of a `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` project.  \\nYou can opt individual files out of type checking with a `// @ts-nocheck` comment at the top of the file:  \\n```js\\n// @ts-nocheck\\nlet easy = \\'abc\\'\\neasy = 123 // No error\\n```  \\nYou can also disable individual errors in a JavaScript file using a `// @ts-ignore` comment on the line before the error:  \\n```js\\nlet easy = \\'abc\\'\\n// @ts-ignore\\neasy = 123 // No error\\n```  \\n**Using a JSConfig or TSConfig**  \\nTo enable type checking for JavaScript files that are part of a `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`, simply add `\"checkJs\": true` to the project\\'s compiler options:  \\n`jsconfig.json`:  \\n```json\\n{\\n\"compilerOptions\": {\\n\"checkJs\": true\\n},\\n\"exclude\": [\\n\"node_modules\"\\n]\\n}\\n```  \\n`tsconfig.json`:  \\n```json\\n{\\n\"compilerOptions\": {\\n\"allowJs\": true,\\n\"checkJs\": true\\n},\\n\"exclude\": [\\n\"node_modules\"\\n]\\n}\\n```  \\nThis enables type checking for all JavaScript files in the project.

       " Document(page_content='See what is new in the Visual Studio Code July 2017 Release (1.15)  \\nTwo releases ago, we introduced a new Emmet implementation (\"Emmet 2.0\"). During its preview, users could opt-in and try new features such as showing Emmet abbreviations in the suggestion/auto-completion list and multi-cursor support for most of the [Emmet actions](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/). In this release, Emmet 2.0 and these features are enabled by default.  \\nNow that Emmet abbreviations are displayed in the suggestion/auto-completion list, VS Code no longer triggers Emmet abbreviations with the `kbstyle(Tab)` key by default. This solves 2 major issues:  \\n* Unexpected Emmet expansions occurring when the user wanted to just add an indent using the `kbstyle(Tab)` key.\\n* Items from the suggestion list getting inserted when the user actually wanted to expand an Emmet abbreviation.  \\nYou can still bind any keyboard shortcut (other than `kbstyle(Tab)` key) to the `editor.emmet.action.expandAbbreviation` command or use **Emmet: Expand Abbreviation** from the **Command Palette**.  \\n>**Note**: To continue to expand Emmet abbreviations and snippets using the `kbstyle(Tab)` key, set `emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab` to `true`.  \\n#### Custom Emmet Snippets  \\nIf you use custom Emmet snippets, you will have to modify them slightly to make them work in the new Emmet.  \\n* HTML: Custom Emmet snippets in HTML should be a valid abbreviation. For example: use `ul>li` instead of `<ul><li></li></ul>`.\\n* CSS: Name the custom Emmet snippets in CSS such that they only contain letters from the snippet value in the order that they appear in the latter, so that the fuzzy matching algorithm of the suggestion list can make the right match. For example, don\\'t use `bc` or `darkc` as the name for `color: black`.

This change has benefits for both [extension debugging](#extension-debugging) and [profiling](#profile-your-extension) as described below.  \\n#### Extension debugging  \\nExtension Host debugging (implemented by VS Code\\'s built-in Node Debugger) has been switched to always use the \"inspector\" protocol which results in the following behavioral difference:  \\nWith the \"inspector\" protocol, the Node.js debugger does not mark breakpoints as \"verified\" until they are bound to a real script location loaded by the runtime. This means that if your extension is not yet activated, breakpoints will appear gray (unverified). But don\\'t worry, they will turn red (verified) as soon as the extension is activated.  \\n![eh breakpoints](images/1_16/eh-breakpoints.gif)  \\n#### Profile your extension  \\nSince the upgraded version of Electron supports the more powerful \"inspector\" protocol, you can now profile extensions using Chrome DevTools. Do the following:  \\n1. Start VS Code from the command line the with `--inspect-extensions=<port>`-flag, for example `code --inspect-extensions=9333`.\\n2. In VS Code, from the **Command Palette** (`F1`), select **Developer: Toggle Developer Tools**, hit `Enter`.\\n3. Select the **Console** tab and find a message that starts with `\"Debugger listening on port 9333\"` and that ends with a `chrome-devtools`-link.\\n4.

In this milestone, we are proposing a \"real\" API that will replace the more-or-less untyped command based mechanism with a typed solution. At the same time we are deprecating the `initialConfigurations` and `startSession` commands (and we will remove them in the October release).  \\nThe new API centers around a `DebugConfigurationProvider` which is registered for a specific debug type (which itself is contributed via a `debuggers` contribution as before). Whenever VS Code needs the initial debug configurations for a newly created launch.json it calls `provideDebugConfigurations` on the registered `DebugConfigurationProvider`s. A method `resolveDebugConfiguration` is called by VS Code when a new debug session is started. The implementation of `resolveDebugConfiguration` can \"massage\" the passed debug configuration by filling in missing values or by adding/changing/removing attributes.  \\n> **Note:** Currently this API is proposed, so in order to use it you must opt into it by adding a `\"enableProposedApi\": true` to `package.json` and you\\'ll have to copy the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) into your extension project.

It is now possible to access the set of all breakpoints of a workspace (`vscode.debug.breakpoints`) and register for notification about added, removed, or changed breakpoints (`vscode.debug.onDidChangeBreakpoints`).  \\nPlease note that accessing breakpoints initially returns an empty array but triggers a subsequent `BreakpointsChangeEvent` event that updates `vscode.debug.breakpoints` to the correct set. So if your code relies on the correct set of breakpoints, don\\'t forget to register for `BreakpointsChangeEvent`s.  \\nThe different types of breakpoints are represented as different subclasses of `Breakpoint`. Currently supported are `SourceBreakpoint` and `FunctionBreakpoint`. Use an `instanceof` check to determine the concrete type.  \\n> **Note:** Currently this API is proposed, so in order to use it, you must opt into it by adding a `\"enableProposedApi\": true` to `package.json` and you\\'ll have to copy the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) into your extension project. Also be aware that you cannot publish an extension to the Marketplace that uses the `enableProposedApi` attribute.  \\n**Output text on Debug Console**  \\nThe proposed Debug Console API from last month has been slightly modified and moved from \"proposed\" to \"official\". An extension can append text to the Debug Console with `vscode.debug.activeDebugConsole.append(text)` or `vscode.debug.activeDebugConsole.appendLine(text)`.

This works fine as long as the extension does not spend a lot of time in its startup sequence. If it does,for instance starting a language server, early activation must be avoided because it could negatively affect other debug extensions.  \\nTo simplify startup, we have introduced two more fine-grained activation events:  \\n* `onDebugInitialConfigurations` is fired just before the `provideDebugConfigurations` method of the `DebugConfigurationProvider` is called.\\n* `onDebugResolve:type` is fired just before the `resolveDebugConfiguration` method of the `DebugConfigurationProvider` for the specified type is called.  \\n**Rule of thumb:** If activation of a debug extensions is lightweight, use `onDebug`.

This feature simplifies debugging of programs that fork or spawn Node.js processes like programs based on the \"cluster\" node module:  \\n![Auto Attach shown with Cluster Example](images/1_20/auto-attach-cluster.gif)  \\nThe feature is enabled by setting the launch config attribute `autoAttachChildProcesses` to true:  \\n```json\\n{\\n\"type\": \"node\",\\n\"request\": \"launch\",\\n\"name\": \"Cluster\",\\n\"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/cluster.js\",\\n\"autoAttachChildProcesses\": true\\n}\\n```  \\n**Please note:** In order to be able to track the subprocesses, we need the process ID of the parent.

Also be aware that you cannot publish an extension to the Marketplace that uses the `enableProposedApi` attribute.  \\n**new `DebugConfigurationProvider.debugAdapterExecutable` replaces `adapterExecutableCommand` commands**  \\nCurrently a debugger extension can contribute the \"hook\"-like command `adapterExecutableCommand` to return a dynamically calculated path (and corresponding program arguments) of the debug adapter about to be launched by VS Code.\\nIn this milestone, we are proposing \"real\" API that replaces the untyped command based mechanism with a typed solution. At the same time we are deprecating the `adapterExecutableCommand` command (and we will remove support for it as soon it is no longer used).  \\nThe new API is an optional method [`debugAdapterExecutable`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/7636a7d6f7d2749833f783e94fd3d48d6a1791cb/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L388-L395) on the `DebugConfigurationProvider` that returns the path and arguments wrapped as an `DebugAdapterExecutable` object.  \\n**Command `vscode.logToDebugConsole` will be removed**  \\nAs [announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_18#_debug-api-updates) in the previous release, we have deprecated the  `vscode.logToDebugConsole` command in favor of real debug API. We plan to remove support for the `vscode.logToDebugConsole` command in the February milestone.  \\n**Run a debug adapter inside the debug extension**  \\nDeveloping a debugger extension typically involves debugging both the extension and the debug adapter in two parallel sessions. VS Code supports this nicely but development could be easier if both the extension and the debug adapter would be one program that could be debugged in one session.  \\nIn this milestone we\\'ve explored a way to run the debug adapter inside the extension. The basic idea is to intercept the launch of a debug session in the `resolveDebugConfiguration` method of a `DebugConfigurationProvider` and starting to listen for connect requests and creating a new debug adapter session for every request. To make VS Code use connect requests (instead of always launching new debug adapter), the launch configuration is modified by adding the `debugServer` attribute to it.  \\nThese [lines of code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug/blob/042d19a27a8e3a08f27a24110506b53fbecc75ce/src/extension.ts#L61-L71) implement this approach for the \"Mock Debug\" extension (enable this feature by setting the compile time flag `EMBED_DEBUG_ADAPTER` to true).', metadata={'Header 2': 'Extension Authoring', 'Header 3': 'Debug API', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_20#Debug_API'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='See what is new in the Visual Studio Code February 2018 Release (1.21)  \\nThe new webview API proposal seeks to make it easier to create and manage webviews. It supersedes the `TextDocumentContentProvider` and `vscode.previewHtml` command approach currently supported. We\\'re still working hard on this API and would love your feedback or suggestions.  \\nThe new webview API focuses on three areas:  \\n* Make webviews first class.\\n* Enable persistence.\\n* Improve security.  \\n**First class**  \\nA `webview` is an editor that renders HTML content. It is conceptually similar to an iframe. You create a new webview using `createWebview`:  \\n```ts\\nconst webview = vscode.window.createWebview(\\nvscode.Uri.parse(\\'cat-counter-ext:webview1\\'), // Identifier\\n\\'Cat Counter\\', // Title\\nvscode.ViewColumn.One, // Column to show in\\n{} // Webview options\\n);\\n```  \\nThis creates and shows the new webview in the given editor group. Set the contents of the webview using the `html` property:  \\n```ts\\nwebview.html = `<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\"en\">\\n<head>\\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n<img src=\\'https://media.giphy.com/media/vFKqnCdLPNOKc/giphy.gif\\'>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n`;\\n```  \\nPassing messages between a webview and your extension is now also much simpler. To post a message to a webview, call `postMessage` in your extension:  \\n```ts\\nwebview.postMessage({\\ntype: \\'change-cats\\',\\nrequestedBreed: \\'siberian\\'\\n});\\n```  \\nAnd add a `message` handler inside the webview itself:  \\n```js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\\'message\\', event => {\\nswitch (event.data.type) {\\ncase \\'change-cats\\':\\ndoChangeCats(event.data.requestedBreed);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n});\\n```  \\nTo post a message from a webview to your extension, call `window.parent.postMessage` inside the webview:  \\n```js\\nwindow.parent.postMessage({\\ntype: \\'did-update-count\\',\\ncount: 9\\n}, \\'*\\');\\n```  \\nAnd add a `onDidReceiveMessage` event handler on the webview object in your extension:  \\n```ts\\nwebview.onDidReceiveMessage(e => {\\nswitch (e.type) {\\ncase \\'did-update-count\\':\\nthis.handleUpdateCatCount(e.count);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}, null, disposables)\\n```  \\n**Persistence**  \\nBy default, a webview\\'s context is destroyed when it is no longer visible, such as when moved to a background tab. The context is automatically recreated once the webview is shown again. If your extension\\'s webview content cannot be quickly persisted and recreated, you can set the `retainContextWhenHidden` option. This preserves the webview\\'s context, even when the webview editor is in the background. This option should only be used when absolutely necessary as webviews have a high memory overhead.  \\nAlso, unlike the existing HTML previews, webviews do not reload when they are moved between editor groups.  \\n**Improved security**  \\nWebviews are also more secure than old HTML previews. By default, webviews do not allow scripts or command URIs, which can help protect your extension\\'s users from content injection attacks. You can enable scripts by setting `enableScripts` and `enableCommandUris` in the `WebviewOptions` when the webview is created.  \\nAlso, webviews now run in their own origin so they can no longer access `file:` resources directly. To load an extension resource, the webview must use the new `vscode-extension-resource:` URI scheme:  \\n```html\\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"vscode-extension-resource:/Users/alice/.vscode-insiders/extensions/bierner.cat-counter-0.1.0/base.css\">\\n```  \\nTo load a resource from the user\\'s workspace, use the `vscode-workspace-resource:` scheme:  \\n```html\\n<img src=\"vscode-workspace-resource:/Users/bob/projects/toast/images/welcome-bread-cat.gif\">\\n```', metadata={'Header 2': 'Proposed Extension APIs', 'Header 3': 'Webview API', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_21#Webview_API'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='See what is new in the Visual Studio Code March 2018 Release (1.22)  \\nTasks have been updated to give users better control over how arguments and the command itself are quoted when executed in a shell like bash or PowerShell. Tasks of type `shell` now support providing the command and its argument separately. Below is an example of a task that list the directory of a folder named `folder with spaces` (observe the space in the name).  \\n```json\\n{\\n\"label\": \"dir\",\\n\"type\": \"shell\",\\n\"command\": \"dir\",\\n\"args\": [\\n\"folder with spaces\"\\n]\\n}\\n```  \\nSince the shell tasks specifies the argument separately, VS Code knows that it should be passed as one argument to the \\'dir\\' command and quotes the argument based on the shell used. For `cmd.exe`, VS Code uses `\"`, for PowerShell `\\'`, and for shells under Linux and macOS `\\'` as well. If you want to control how the argument is quoted, the argument can be a literal specifying the value and a quoting style. For example:  \\n```json\\n{\\n\"label\": \"dir\",\\n\"type\": \"shell\",\\n\"command\": \"dir\",\\n\"args\": [\\n{\\n\"value\": \"folder with spaces\",\\n\"quoting\": \"escape\"\\n}\\n]\\n}\\n```  \\nThis will escape the spaces in the argument using the shell\\'s escape character which is backtick under PowerShell and `\\\\`under bash. If the shell used doesn\\'t support character escaping, the strong quotes are used.  \\nBesides escaping the following values are supported:  \\n* **strong**: Uses the shell\\'s strong quoting mechanism which suppresses all evaluations inside the string. Under PowerShell and for shells under Linux and macOS, single quotes are used (`\\'`). For cmd.exe, `\"` is used.\\n* **weak**: Uses the shell\\'s weak quoting mechanism which still evaluates expression inside the string (for example, environment variables). Under PowerShell and for shells under Linux and macOS, double quotes are used (`\"`). cmd.exe doesn\\'t support weak quoting so VS Code uses `\"` as well.  \\nIf the command itself contains spaces, VS Code will by default strong quote the command as well. As with arguments, the user can control the quoting of the command using the same literal style.  \\nNote that the old style of having the whole command line in the `command` property is still supported.  \\nThe same support has been added to the task API so task providers also have full control over quoting and escaping.', metadata={'Header 2': 'Tasks', 'Header 3': 'Improved argument quoting', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#Improved_argument_quoting'}),\n",

A terminal renderer is basically a terminal instance within the terminal panel but it has no backing process, instead the **extension** acts as the process. This is useful for implementing a terminal multiplexer within VS Code where the extension has access to the in/out pipes of some process, which are hooked then up to the terminal renderer. The [Live Share extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) is planning on using this new API to improve the stability and maintainability of its shared terminal support.  \\n```ts\\nexport namespace window {\\nexport function createTerminalRenderer(name: string): TerminalRenderer;\\n}  \\nexport interface TerminalRenderer {\\nname: string;\\ndimensions: TerminalDimensions | undefined;\\nreadonly maximumDimensions: TerminalDimensions | undefined;\\nreadonly terminal: Terminal;\\nreadonly onDidAcceptInput: Event<string>;\\nreadonly onDidChangeMaximumDimensions: Event<TerminalDimensions>;\\nwrite(text: string): void;\\n}  \\nexport interface TerminalDimensions {\\nreadonly columns: number;\\nreadonly rows: number;\\n}\\n```  \\nAnother example use case is an extension creating its own REPL.

If there are no breakpoints (or problems) in that shutdown code, the debuggee and the debug session will terminate. The user will not see any difference in behavior to previous versions of VS Code.  \\n3. However, if the debugger hits a breakpoint in the shutdown code or if the debuggee does not terminate properly by itself, then the debug session will not end.  \\n4. In this case, pressing the **Stop** button again will force terminate the debuggee. So if you see that a debug session doesn't end when you press the red **Stop** button, then press the button again to force a shutdown of the debuggee.  \\n**Note**: This feature is only supported by debugger extensions that have opted into implementing it. Currently this is only the built-in Node.js debugger. We expect other debug extensions to support this feature soon.\", metadata={'Header 2': 'Debugging', 'Header 3': 'Improved stop debug behavior', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#Improved_stop_debug_behavior'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='See what is new in the Visual Studio Code July 2018 Release (1.26)  \\nPreviously, `\"smartStep\": true` would cause the Node.js debugger to not stop in source code without source maps. This can happen in two ways:  \\n* Files that don\\'t have source maps at all (source code that isn\\'t transpiled or .js files shipped with node modules).\\n* Transpiled files that do have source maps, but there are individual lines that aren\\'t mapped (extra lines that TypeScript inserts when down compiling some features like async/await).  \\nWith VS Code 1.26, `\"smartStep\": true` will only affect the second type, lines that are missing from a source map. Now you\\'ll be able to step into .js files while still skipping TS async/await code.  \\nWe changed this because we realized that the old smartStep behavior was too aggressive. Skipping inserted code is usually correct, but skipping in the first scenario only makes sense for some projects and users. In addition, using the `skipFiles` option in your `launch.json` configuration file does a better job of covering the case for entire files, since it can target files more precisely and is faster.  \\nSo, if you are using `smartStep` and notice that the debugger is no longer auto-skipping through files without source maps, you can use `skipFiles` to get the previous behavior back. See [Skipping uninteresting code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_skipping-uninteresting-code-node-chrome) for examples of how to configure `skipFiles` to skip source code in node_modules, internal node files, or any other files that you don\\'t want to step through.', metadata={'Header 2': 'Debugging', 'Header 3': 'Changed smartStep behavior for Node/Chrome debugging', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#Changed_smartStep_behavior_for_Node/Chrome_debugging'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"See what is new in the Visual Studio Code September 2018 Release (1.28)  \\nExtensions can use the `workspaceContains` activation event to be activated when a workspace is opened that contains a file matching some pattern. For example, a PHP extension might ask to be activated when a workspace with a file matching `**/*.php` is opened. This isn't new, but users have pointed out that the search process can run for a long time and use a lot of CPU when a large workspace is opened.  \\nWe made a couple changes to make these searches less impactful. The first is that these searches will now respect the users' `files.exclude`, `search.exclude`, and `search.useIgnoreFiles` settings. In other words, if the user is not able to find a file in a normal text search or file search via Quick Open, a `workspaceContains` pattern won't match on that file. This greatly reduces the number of files that we have to search for `workspaceContains`, and reduces incorrect activations when it matches a file that isn't really part of the project, for example, some file buried in `node_modules/`.  \\nThe second change is to impose a 7 second limit on these searches. If the search has not completed after 7 seconds, we kill the search process and activate the extension anyway.  \\nOverall, this should reduce cases of your laptop mysteriously heating up after opening a large workspace in VS Code.\", metadata={'Header 2': 'Extension Authoring', 'Header 3': '`workspaceContains` activation', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#`workspaceContains`_activation'}),\n",

With this information, an extension has the \"full picture\" when being asked to create the debug adapter.  \\nIn addition, we now support more ways for starting and connecting to the debug adapter implementation. For this, a descriptor object can be returned from the `provideDebugAdapter` method:  \\n* A `DebugAdapterExecutable` descriptor can be used to launch the debug adapter as an external process per session and communicates with it via stdin/stdout. With the new API, it is now possible to specify the working directory and environment variables for the debug adapter.\\n* A `DebugAdapterServer` describes a server process that handles multiple sessions and communicates via a socket.\\n* A `DebugAdapterImplementation` can be used for an in-place implementation that has no communication overhead. This option relies on a small modification to the [Node.js based client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-debugadapter) for DAP and is planned for October.  \\nPlease note that this is proposed API and cannot be used in extensions published on the Marketplace.

However, if the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension is installed/enabled, discovery is still triggered by Jupyter at startup.  \\n#### Enable localization  \\nThe Python extension now supports translations in all the languages that VS Code supports. We have updated the way we get the translations of our commands, notifications, titles, etc. using [vscode-nls](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-nls). These translations are maintained by a localization team to ensure that they are up to date and correct.\", 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_68#-no-interpreter-discovery-at-startup',

      "{'content': 'Learn what is new in the Visual Studio Code June 2022 Release (1.69)  \\n#### Sourcemap toggling  \\nYou can now easily toggle sourcemaps on and off by clicking the 🧭 compass icon in the title of the Call Stack view. When sourcemaps are toggled off, breakpoints set in the source code will still work, but be moved to their equivalent locations in compiled code, and the debugger will step through compiled code instead of source code.  \\n<video src=\"images/1_69/js-debug-toggle-sourcemaps.mp4\" autoplay loop controls muted title=\"Toggling sourcemaps off and on during a JavaScript debugging session\"></video>  \\n_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)_  \\nWhen sourcemaps are turned off, a similar button is shown in the debug toolbar that can turn them back on. Toggle state is persisted in the workspace.  \\n#### toString() variable previews  \\nIf a variable or property has a custom `toString()` method, it will be called to render the preview in the **VARIABLES** view and hovers. This is an improvement over generic object previews for complex types that have good string representations.  \\nFor example, VS Code\\'s `Range` has a `toString` method that makes it easier to digest at a glance:  \\n![Displaying the toString() method output in the Variables view](images/1_69/js-debug-custom-tostring.png)  \\n#### Step Into Target support  \\nThe JavaScript debugger now supports **Step Into Target**, allowing you to easily step into function calls on a line of code.  \\n![Step Into Targets dropdown](images/1_69/js-debug-step-in-target.png)  \\nThis can be accessed via the **Debug: Step Into Target** command (`kb(workbench.action.debug.stepIntoTarget)`) or by right-clicking on the line.  \\n#### Unbound breakpoint warning icon in JavaScript debugging  \\nIf you are debugging a TypeScript/JavaScript project and having trouble configuring sourcemaps or getting your breakpoints to bind, VS Code will now show a hint message in the Breakpoints view with a link to the JavaScript debugger\\'s breakpoint troubleshooting tool. You will also see the hint when hovering the gray breakpoint icon in the editor.  \\n![hovering the breakpoint warning icon](images/1_69/bp-hover.png)  \\nWhen the API to show this hint is finalized, other debuggers will be able to show the hint with their own appropriate message.', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#-sourcemap-toggling', 'content_embeddings':

      "{'content': 'Learn what is new in the Visual Studio Code June 2022 Release (1.69)  \\n#### IPyWidgets  \\n`IPyWidgets` are now supported for kernels other than `Python`, such as [Common Lisp](https://github.com/yitzchak/common-lisp-jupyter) and [IHaskell](https://github.com/IHaskell/IHaskell).  \\n<video src=\"images/1_69/jupyter_ihaskell_widgets.mp4\" autoplay loop controls muted title=\"IPyWidget support in IHaskell\"></video>  \\nA number of `IPyWidget` issues related to loading of resources (images, scripts, etc.) have been resolved, thereby improving support for widgets such as [VegaFusion](https://github.com/vegafusion/vegafusion), [ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [Chemiscope](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/chemiscope), [mobilechelonian](https://github.com/takluyver/mobilechelonian), and [ipyturtle](https://github.com/gkvoelkl/ipython-turtle-widget).  \\n<video src=\"images/1_69/jupyter_chemiscope_widget.mp4\" autoplay loop controls muted title=\"IPyWidget support for Chemiscope\"></video>  \\nOther notable `IPyWidget` fixes include displaying complex and nested (including interactive) outputs within the [Jupyter Output widget](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Output%20Widget.html).  \\n#### Web extension  \\nWe\\'ve made progress on supporting more of the core functionality in the web version of the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension.  \\nThis month the following features were ported to the web extension:  \\n* Exporting an Interactive Window\\n* Debugging an Interactive Window\\n* Collapsible cells in an Interactive Window  \\nIf you\\'d like to experiment with the functionality, launch Jupyter from your local machine with:  \\n```bash\\njupyter notebook --no-browser --NotebookApp.allow_origin_pat=https://.*\\\\.vscode-cdn\\\\.net\\n```  \\nAnd then connect to it using the command **Jupyter: Specify Jupyter server for connections** from within [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev).  \\nFor more information (and to comment), see this [discussion item](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/discussions/10315).', 'url': 'https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#-ipywidgets', 'content_embeddings': [-0.045392412692308426,
